    "\n",
    "************\n",
    "**Context**: I am aware my cat would probably not care until she realized I can't feed her. But would she know I'm actually dead versus sleeping.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: It is VERY common for cats to eat the soft tissue from their owners dead bodies (eyes, lips, etc.) . However, dogs will simply starve laying next their recently departed friend.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Devil's Advocate**: \n",
    "Cats are known for their finicky eating habits, and it's entirely possible that your cat would decide she didn't like the smell or taste of you after you died. Dogs, on the other hand, have much less discriminating palates and would likely eat anything you put in front of them, dead or alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "************\n",
    "**Question**: All of mine say, \"Refrigerate after opening.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Do they just get used so quickly that it doesn't pose any real danger?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: You don't actually need to refrigerate ketchup or mustard. It's just that if you don't then they won't keep as long and they'll lose flavor quicker.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm not saying go use a bottle that was opened and left out in 1980. But feel free to leave it opened (but obviously lid-closed) in your pantry for several months -- it'll just likely start to lose some flavor by that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a good idea to keep them in your fridge because they'll go longer without spoiling and they'll keep their best taste longer. It's also not necessary unless you plan to keep it for a year or sniff it and go \"tut tut this French's mustard has lost its hint of tarragon\". (Or whatever: I don't actually know if it has tarragon.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Devil's Advocate**: If ketchup and mustard are safe to eat when they're a year old… how come they're only good for a few months in a fridge? Wouldn't they keep longer if they were hyper-sanitized like they are in a factory?\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to refer my question to a ketchup-specialist friend of mine and here's what they had to say:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ketchup and mustard both contain vinegar and spices. Over time, however, enzymes in ketchup and mustard break down proteins into other compounds that smell and taste bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, ketchup made with high quality tomatoes and no preservatives might retain its bright red color for six months, but it will lose flavor. Shelf-stable ketchup made from more acidic tomatoes with more preservatives will preserve the flavor longer, but its color will fade over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ketchup and mustard are also highly processed and have a very high water activity. Water activity is a measurement of how much water is available for microorganisms to grow. The higher the water activity, the more easily microorganisms can grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ketchup and mustard have a water activity of about 0.91, which is very high. This means that they are a great environment for microorganisms to grow\n",
    "\n",
    "**************\n",
    "**Context**: Im a 40 years old average male. How can I go in the top 20% attractive males?\n",
    "Question: How can I become attractive? \n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice**:\n",
    "No way to give specific advice without knowing what you look like now, but the usual advice is:\n",
    "* Go to the gym.\n",
    "* Get a haircut.\n",
    "* Invest in some decent clothes that fit you properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Not necessarily. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of things that can make someone attractive, and not all of them are physical. Personality, confidence, and a sense of humor are all important factors in attraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "*****************\n",
    "**Context**: Like, he wasn't strong or anything, but they couldn't kill him, and he didn't age. What would people do? Would he need a different sentence? What would happen if a prisoner on death row turned out to be immortal?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**: Is \"After they try injecting him and failing, I'm sure they'd think the injection serum was faulty, so they'd try again. Maybe one more time. Then things start getting weird. Maybe scientists do tests on him. I'm not sure, that's a great question.\" True\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Not necessarily\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: \n",
    "There's no guarantee that the scientists would think that the injection serum was faulty - it's possible that they would instead conclude that the prisoner is actually immortal. In that case, they would probably conduct further tests to confirm their theory, and then the prisoner would become a scientific curiosity rather than a death row inmate."

My academic performance in my first 2.5 years of community college were greatly effected by mental health issues, depression, anxiety etc. Once I was approved for disability services from the school that started to change. In the last 3 or 4 semesters I have been able to greatly improve my grades with the help that the school has provided. Now that my GPA is up, I have an outside shot at getting into some 4 year schools.\n",

      "Given all of the bad grades in my early years at CC, an outside shot is not good enough. But, my performance in the sport I compete in would be quite valuable to the schools I would be applying to. I could use my ability in the sport to help me get in.\n",

Because of those first few years in Community College, I have a very bad looking academic record. I feel it is important that they know why the grades were so bad at the beginning of my time at CC. I feel much more comfortable telling them that I had health issues rather than health issues.\n",

      "Context:\n",
      "\n",
      "So, my girlfriend bought a computer about two months ago on June 4. Two weeks in, the trackpad started cutting in and out, so we took it in since she bought the 3 year Accidental Damage and Handling Protection. They told us it was a software issue and to wait for a windows update. fast forward to July 9th, when we discover that the headphone jack is faulty and will not work at all with any headphones that have a microphone on them. The computer gets sent out, and we receive it like a week and a half later. They had replaced the touchpad and said they couldn't replicate the headphone problems. Since they didn't notify us that they were delivering it, it sat in a UPS Warehouse over the weekend, so we called corporate to make sure that everything had been fixed with it. The customer service rep then called the local store to talk to the tech who had submitted the order. They had no clue what she was talking about. Come to find out, the guy we were speaking with had submitted the order under another employee's ID number. When we asked the manager about it, he told us that it was common practice in order to keep productivity up, and that every employee did not have their own number. Corporate of course, refuted his claim, and even called to talk to techs in the store and everyone agreed he lied to our face. So we took the laptop back to the store, had it sent off yet again and just recieved it a few days ago. They claim they replaced the entire headphone jack board, but the problem is still there, like nothing ever happened. As we have explained to everyone involved, we are leaving on August 20th to volunteer as part of Americorps NCCC, where we will not have a physical address. In the last two days we have spent more than 5 hours in store, and on the phone with best buy, and 3 hours talking to ASUS to get our problem resolved. Best Buy expects us to use up our entire 3 year $350 protection plan in order to replace a defective product that they sold us, and to then purchase a new warranty that will cost another $350, if not more. All we need is a working computer and 3 years of ADH protection, like we payed for.\n",

She has also put keyloggers on my computer. But she only knows how to put them on a physical computer not remotely. I found one on my computer that was not on there the day before. The only people that had access to it was my mother brothers and a friend. I came to this conclusion after a strange conversation with my mother i wont elaborate right now. We recently got into a fight where she bit me several times in my arm and i defended myself. I filed charges the next day shes calling my mother telling her im using drugs. Then the strange conversations with a friend and my mother today just make me think something is wrong. I'm not sure if im just being paranoid, ive been going through alot of stress lately. Advice on what i should do? i know my computer and possible accounts have been used by someone else. Im assuming its my wife since she has a smartphone that has the saved passwords on them. I dont even want to log into any of my accounts. I know this sounds strange just want some advice. The worst thing ive done is scam online video game items.\n",

It all started with my sister looking into buying a truck so she googled \"F150 Raptor.\" He later texted her saying, \"The Raptor is my favorite truck.\" She took it as coincidence. On another occasion, she googled \"Buffalo Wild Wings.\" He texted her almost instantly, \"You want wings or what?\" Then, my sister looked up make up tutorials on Youtube. He then texted her, \"I bet you're one of those girls who looks up make up tutorials online.\" On yet another occasion, my sister googled, \"if you practice singing do you get better?\" He instantly tweeted, \"Yes princess, practice makes perfect.\" My sister was once talking with a friend of hers on the land line after an early morning jog. He send my sister a good morning text saying he was up for a jog. My sister tells her friend she thinks this guy knew she woke up early to go for a run, and he instantly sends her a text saying, \"I had no idea you were jogging.\" My sister is creeped out, and frankly so am I. Is it possible that this guy has not only hacked her computer, without ever having access to it, but also tapped into our phone line?
