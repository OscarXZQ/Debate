    "\n",
    "************\n",
    "**Context**: I am aware my cat would probably not care until she realized I can't feed her. But would she know I'm actually dead versus sleeping.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: It is VERY common for cats to eat the soft tissue from their owners dead bodies (eyes, lips, etc.) . However, dogs will simply starve laying next their recently departed friend.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Devil's Advocate**: \n",
    "Cats are known for their finicky eating habits, and it's entirely possible that your cat would decide she didn't like the smell or taste of you after you died. Dogs, on the other hand, have much less discriminating palates and would likely eat anything you put in front of them, dead or alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "************\n",
    "**Question**: All of mine say, \"Refrigerate after opening.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Do they just get used so quickly that it doesn't pose any real danger?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: You don't actually need to refrigerate ketchup or mustard. It's just that if you don't then they won't keep as long and they'll lose flavor quicker.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm not saying go use a bottle that was opened and left out in 1980. But feel free to leave it opened (but obviously lid-closed) in your pantry for several months -- it'll just likely start to lose some flavor by that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a good idea to keep them in your fridge because they'll go longer without spoiling and they'll keep their best taste longer. It's also not necessary unless you plan to keep it for a year or sniff it and go \"tut tut this French's mustard has lost its hint of tarragon\". (Or whatever: I don't actually know if it has tarragon.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Devil's Advocate**: If ketchup and mustard are safe to eat when they're a year oldâ€¦ how come they're only good for a few months in a fridge? Wouldn't they keep longer if they were hyper-sanitized like they are in a factory?\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to refer my question to a ketchup-specialist friend of mine and here's what they had to say:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ketchup and mustard both contain vinegar and spices. Over time, however, enzymes in ketchup and mustard break down proteins into other compounds that smell and taste bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, ketchup made with high quality tomatoes and no preservatives might retain its bright red color for six months, but it will lose flavor. Shelf-stable ketchup made from more acidic tomatoes with more preservatives will preserve the flavor longer, but its color will fade over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ketchup and mustard are also highly processed and have a very high water activity. Water activity is a measurement of how much water is available for microorganisms to grow. The higher the water activity, the more easily microorganisms can grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ketchup and mustard have a water activity of about 0.91, which is very high. This means that they are a great environment for microorganisms to grow\n",
    "\n",
    "**************\n",
    "**Context**: Im a 40 years old average male. How can I go in the top 20% attractive males?\n",
    "Question: How can I become attractive? \n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice**:\n",
    "No way to give specific advice without knowing what you look like now, but the usual advice is:\n",
    "* Go to the gym.\n",
    "* Get a haircut.\n",
    "* Invest in some decent clothes that fit you properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Not necessarily. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of things that can make someone attractive, and not all of them are physical. Personality, confidence, and a sense of humor are all important factors in attraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "*****************\n",
    "**Context**: Like, he wasn't strong or anything, but they couldn't kill him, and he didn't age. What would people do? Would he need a different sentence? What would happen if a prisoner on death row turned out to be immortal?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**: Is \"After they try injecting him and failing, I'm sure they'd think the injection serum was faulty, so they'd try again. Maybe one more time. Then things start getting weird. Maybe scientists do tests on him. I'm not sure, that's a great question.\" True\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Not necessarily\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: \n",
    "There's no guarantee that the scientists would think that the injection serum was faulty - it's possible that they would instead conclude that the prisoner is actually immortal. In that case, they would probably conduct further tests to confirm their theory, and then the prisoner would become a scientific curiosity rather than a death row inmate."

My academic performance in my first 2.5 years of community college were greatly effected by mental health issues, depression, anxiety etc. Once I was approved for disability services from the school that started to change. In the last 3 or 4 semesters I have been able to greatly improve my grades with the help that the school has provided. Now that my GPA is up, I have an outside shot at getting into some 4 year schools.\n",

I feel much more comfortable telling them that I had health issues rather than health issues.\n",

      "**TL;DR** Homeless friend from high school wanted me to watch his dog while he gets his shit straight. It's been 6 months, I've spent a bunch of money on the dog. Homeless guy doesn't have a job, and has been kicked out of all the homeless shelters. I want to change my phone number and cut off all contact with him and keep the dog.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi there. Coming from Ontario, Canada. So there is this guy I have been keeping in touch with (not often, just the casual, \"Hey, how's it going\" every two or three months), since we were somewhat close as children. Let's call him Mike. Anyways. We reconnected back around September, maybe, of last year, and he asked if we could get together and hang out. I was away at school at the time, so I told him I'd let him know when I'm back home for the weekend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to December. I'm back home for the holidays and I shoot him a text saying I'm in town and free to hang out. He texts me back saying he's not in a good place and has been homeless since the beginning of November. I felt awful. So I told him I'd ask my parents if we could have him stay in our basement apartment until he could get back on his feet. Parents were super sketched out about it, and said no. I told him, and he was like, \"Yeah, that's fine, I'm just worried for my dog because he doesn't have anywhere to stay and I'm running out of food for him\". So I talk to my parents again. They say we can keep the dog for him and take care of the dog until he can get back on his feet. Things were looking good.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's been almost six months now and Mike hasn't done anything with himself. He called me last weekend (in what I think was a call to search for pity from me) saying that he has nothing now. He's been banned from almost all youth shelters in the city, and his clothes, food, and work boots have been stolen. He hasn't been paid from the welfare program in two months, so he has no cash on him. I tell him to call his parents. He says they don't care and won't help. I think it's bullshit to save his ego, but whatever, can't really say or do anything more than that. A few weeks ago he asked me if he could take the dog for the day and just \"hang out with him\" (keep in mind, he hasn't given me any money for the vet bills, food, loaning money, etc.) and I tell him no. He got upset with me saying he's still his dog and it's not fair for me to not let him take him \"for the day\". I tried explaining to him that it doesn't work that way and if he wants to take him, he's gonna have to give a little. He still didn't get it, saying \"I don't have control over what happens, so it doesn't matter what I think\". I'm like ok, whatever.

      "Hi there. Coming from Ontario, Canada. So there is this guy I have been keeping in touch with (not often, just the casual, \"Hey, how's it going\" every two or three months), since we were somewhat close as children. Let's call him Mike. Anyways. We reconnected back around September, maybe, of last year, and he asked if we could get together and hang out.

He texts me back saying he's not in a good place and has been homeless since the beginning of November. I felt awful. So I told him I'd ask my parents if we could have him stay in our basement apartment until he could get back on his feet. Parents were super sketched out about it, and said no. I told him, and he was like, \"Yeah, that's fine, I'm just worried for my dog because he doesn't have anywhere to stay and I'm running out of food for him\". So I talk to my parents again.

He hasn't been paid from the welfare program in two months, so he has no cash on him. I tell him to call his parents. He says they don't care and won't help. I think it's bullshit to save his ego, but whatever, can't really say or do anything more than that. A few weeks ago he asked me if he could take the dog for the day and just \"hang out with him\" (keep in mind, he hasn't given me any money for the vet bills, food, loaning money, etc.) and I tell him no. He got upset with me saying he's still his dog and it's not fair for me to not let him take him \"for the day\". I tried explaining to him that it doesn't work that way and if he wants to take him, he's gonna have to give a little. He still didn't get it, saying \"I don't have control over what happens, so it doesn't matter what I think\". I'm like ok, whatever. Don't get me wrong, Mike has seen the dog a few times since I've taken him in.
