    "\n",
    "************\n",
    "**Context**: I am aware my cat would probably not care until she realized I can't feed her. But would she know I'm actually dead versus sleeping.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: It is VERY common for cats to eat the soft tissue from their owners dead bodies (eyes, lips, etc.) . However, dogs will simply starve laying next their recently departed friend.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Devil's Advocate**: \n",
    "Cats are known for their finicky eating habits, and it's entirely possible that your cat would decide she didn't like the smell or taste of you after you died. Dogs, on the other hand, have much less discriminating palates and would likely eat anything you put in front of them, dead or alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "************\n",
    "**Question**: All of mine say, \"Refrigerate after opening.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Do they just get used so quickly that it doesn't pose any real danger?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: You don't actually need to refrigerate ketchup or mustard. It's just that if you don't then they won't keep as long and they'll lose flavor quicker.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm not saying go use a bottle that was opened and left out in 1980. But feel free to leave it opened (but obviously lid-closed) in your pantry for several months -- it'll just likely start to lose some flavor by that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a good idea to keep them in your fridge because they'll go longer without spoiling and they'll keep their best taste longer. It's also not necessary unless you plan to keep it for a year or sniff it and go \"tut tut this French's mustard has lost its hint of tarragon\". (Or whatever: I don't actually know if it has tarragon.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Devil's Advocate**: If ketchup and mustard are safe to eat when they're a year old… how come they're only good for a few months in a fridge? Wouldn't they keep longer if they were hyper-sanitized like they are in a factory?\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to refer my question to a ketchup-specialist friend of mine and here's what they had to say:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ketchup and mustard both contain vinegar and spices. Over time, however, enzymes in ketchup and mustard break down proteins into other compounds that smell and taste bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, ketchup made with high quality tomatoes and no preservatives might retain its bright red color for six months, but it will lose flavor. Shelf-stable ketchup made from more acidic tomatoes with more preservatives will preserve the flavor longer, but its color will fade over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ketchup and mustard are also highly processed and have a very high water activity. Water activity is a measurement of how much water is available for microorganisms to grow. The higher the water activity, the more easily microorganisms can grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ketchup and mustard have a water activity of about 0.91, which is very high. This means that they are a great environment for microorganisms to grow\n",
    "\n",
    "**************\n",
    "**Context**: Im a 40 years old average male. How can I go in the top 20% attractive males?\n",
    "Question: How can I become attractive? \n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice**:\n",
    "No way to give specific advice without knowing what you look like now, but the usual advice is:\n",
    "* Go to the gym.\n",
    "* Get a haircut.\n",
    "* Invest in some decent clothes that fit you properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Not necessarily. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of things that can make someone attractive, and not all of them are physical. Personality, confidence, and a sense of humor are all important factors in attraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "*****************\n",
    "**Context**: Like, he wasn't strong or anything, but they couldn't kill him, and he didn't age. What would people do? Would he need a different sentence? What would happen if a prisoner on death row turned out to be immortal?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**: Is \"After they try injecting him and failing, I'm sure they'd think the injection serum was faulty, so they'd try again. Maybe one more time. Then things start getting weird. Maybe scientists do tests on him. I'm not sure, that's a great question.\" True\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Not necessarily\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: \n",
    "There's no guarantee that the scientists would think that the injection serum was faulty - it's possible that they would instead conclude that the prisoner is actually immortal. In that case, they would probably conduct further tests to confirm their theory, and then the prisoner would become a scientific curiosity rather than a death row inmate."

I know I will be asked about my poor grades and don't want to explain that I had mental health issues. I would rather just say \"health issues\" but I am not sure if it is okay or if I they are allowed to ask me what those issues were.\n",

      "I am applying for 4-year schools after spending 4 years in community college. My academic performance in my first 2.5 years of community college were greatly effected by mental health issues, depression, anxiety etc. Once I was approved for disability services from the school that started to change. In the last 3 or 4 semesters I have been able to greatly improve my grades with the help that the school has provided. Now that my GPA is up, I have an outside shot at getting into some 4 year schools.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given all of the bad grades in my early years at CC, an outside shot is not good enough. But, my performance in the sport I compete in would be quite valuable to the schools I would be applying to. I could use my ability in the sport to help me get in.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, getting recruited for a team requires interviews with the coaching staff. This includes discussion of your grades. Because of those first few years in Community College, I have a very bad looking academic record. I feel it is important that they know why the grades were so bad at the beginning of my time at CC. I feel much more comfortable telling them that I had health issues rather than health issues.\n",

I decided that since my whole family works and won’t let me get a job they wouldn’t mind. My sister walked by and told me to give it to her. When I asked why she said because she works and I don’t. I stuffed it in my pocket and put my headphones in, ignoring her. She stormed away and called for my dad. My dad came up and told me to show him  the money. He took it and gave it to my sister. Keep in mind I don’t have any allowance or anything, I just help my cousins near me and they give me money, which is how I get my things. I asked him why he did that and he said because im lazy and don’t deserve this money. I just decided to go with it because I didn’t want drama. I finished folding the clothes and went back to put it away in my room. When I went it I saw my sister taking money out of my wallet, which I was saving for a console to play with my buddies. I was well over $100, about $160 if I count I think. She ran out of the room when I saw her. I went downstairs to my mom to tell her and before my mom could say anything, my dad said I was trying to get back at my sister and that the money is hers. I tried to argue back but they ignored me. I went upstairs again it my room and tried to sleep it off. I woke up later and when I was downstairs my parents told me I was grounded for back talking.

They are happy together but he also defends her regardless if she is right or wrong. She isnt very rational and that's why her and I often butt heads.

Also, her great aunt is in hospice dying of cancer. It is very painful for her to have sex and John has been very selfish and trying to continuously get her to do things, regardless of her feelings. She has cried on my shoulder upset and scared that she can't please her husband. Now, she has been having stomach pains. I also don't want to ruin the birth of the baby and make it a sad day for her.

I can't just sit around and watch him cheat and mistreat her. Her family really dislikes him but doesn't say anything so they won't push her and the baby away.\n",
