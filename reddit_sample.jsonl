You can't solve an emotional problem by applying more logic to it. There is an imbalance in your relationship that is probably related to your separate finances.\n\nYou present the problem as, \"She spends money on silly stuff.\" Silly stuff is not a numeric valuation, it is your opinion. To fix the problem it's not to convince her that what she buys is stupid, but what motivates her to make unwise financial decisions. If you approach her with the \"silly stuff\" idea, it's just going to make her defensive and unwilling to collaborate on solving the problem. It's much easier to come at a problem from your view, but most likely any changes she makes will be temporary. Getting to the bottom of why she spends like this is tough, but it might actually address what is creating these habits.","id":"coc21ph","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1424162680},{"created_utc":1423169717,"subreddit":"relationships","author":"tiat-araus","parent_id":"2uveiv","link_id":"2uveiv","score":17,"body":"I'm getting sort of a weird vibe from you OP. You insist that your finances are shared but then also talk about your debt obligations 'in the eyes of lenders' vs how *you* see it. You've mentioned conversations where she talks about how much you're spending and you explain that you budget for it - this implies you guys don't have joint finances, and you have more spending money than she does. You also said that you'd give her access to the joint account when her debt is paid off -- that makes it sound like the debt is her responsibility while the money is yours. These kinds of power imbalance in terms of money are really bad for a marriage.\n\nHere are the important things I think you need to do:\n\n1) get on the same page about \"big\" financial goals - buying a house, retirement, kids, etc. Long-term, what do you want out of life *as a family*?\n\n2) get a clear understanding of your joint financial situation -- all debts, income and expenses of the 2 of you. This means the credit card debt belongs to both of you, as does the joint chequing account. If she doesn't want to share that stuff, go back to the long-term financial goals. You can't build a future together if you can't cooperate (and if that's the case, why are you still married?)\n\n3) make a plan and a budget.\n\nThe simplest method is to deposit all income into one account from which expenses are paid, and then each have a separate account into which your individual \"allowances\" are deposited. All spending of the joint account is a joint decision, but allowances are personal.\n\nAnother method is to add up all joint expenses (food, rent, savings, etc) and then each contribute part of that amount to the joint account in proportion to your income. So if your joint expenses are $2000 and you earn 60k and she earns 40k, then you would contribute 60% (1200) to the joint account and she would contribute 800. Then the rest of the money is left to each of you for discretionary spending and things like her credit card bills. However, I feel like that system would promote the \"yours vs mine\" attitude that seems to exist in your marriage right now. You would also have to decide which expenses are joint. If you wanted to go on a vacation together, would that come out of your joint savings or personal accounts?\n\nOverall, I would say that you need to focus less on how to get your wife to stop spending money and more on how to address your finances as a partnership rather than as 2 separate entities who happen to live together and have the same last name.","id":"cocdwpl","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1424151224},{"created_utc":1423146209,"subreddit":"relationships","author":"sirshartsalot","parent_id":"2uveiv","link_id":"2uveiv","score":159,"body":"You need counseling - financial counseling.

Very sad to say he didn\u2019t take ANY OF IT. Instead he kept quiet and asks me to use my credit card because he\u2019s poor because he didn\u2019t want his son to have a criminal record. Haha. Whatever. Not important now.\n\nThe issue now is that my father found blood and needles and heroin sitting on a plate in my brothers bedroom. I get a phone call, he shoves the responsibility on me, saying it will be me that regrets it when my brother dies, bla bla... So here we are again!\n\nWhat the hell do I do?\n\nMy first piece of advice for him was to kick my brother out. Because my brother has a roof over his head, eats well, and even just bought a car. He won\u2019t want to change until shit gets real bad, right? Well I guess that wasn\u2019t what my father wanted to hear.\n\nI\u2019ve been calling rehab centers all morning but most of them seem to cost around $300 a day and the program is a minimum of 90 days... I don\u2019t have that kind of money. Is there anyone that knows of any other programs around Vancouver BC that are worth calling? I dont even think my brother wants help so is rehab even the answer?\n\nDo I even bother? Seeing as my father was not receptive to my advice last time, should I even waste any more time? I love my brother, but I\u2019m worried our dad will ask me to take him! I live in a small apartment and I am not going to have him stay with me only to slowly steal everything I own.\n\nHonestly just want to change cities, change my name and phone number and never talk to any of them again.\n\nTLDR; Need advice on what to do about brothers heroin addiction.","id":"79psks","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1510497153,"good_comments":[{"created_utc":1509389609,"subreddit":"relationships","author":"wangleed","parent_id":"79psks","link_id":"79psks","score":26,"body":"You can't take the responsibility and duty of a father.Period.\n\nMove away if you can.Once you do that, your father might get forced to take his responsibility.\n\nYou feeling guilty is understandable but you did your best.","id":"dp3u2pd","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1510333224},{"created_utc":1509391456,"subreddit":"relationships","author":"[deleted]","parent_id":"79psks","link_id":"79psks","score":27,"body":">Honestly just want to change cities, change my name and phone number and never talk to any of them again.\n\nWell since the alternative is sacrificing your time, home, income, and sanity....","id":"dp3vucl","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1510334117},{"created_utc":1509391034,"subreddit":"relationships","author":"-clover-","parent_id":"79psks","link_id":"79psks","score":80,"body":"I am so damn sorry you're going through this.

No one took your advice.\n\nI'm saying all this from personal experience. When I was 15, my best friend got addicted to meth and later on heroin. She was 13. I put this all on my own shoulders. I cried so many nights, worked with her boyfriend to try to get her to stop. No one else was trying to do anything about it. She ended up OD'ing and passed away shortly after I turned 16.\n\nYears later, my sister became addicted to heroin. I tried my hardest to talk her into getting help. She's been in and out of prison. She stays off the drugs for a while, but goes right back if she's able. There is nothing I can do. We haven't spoken in a while. The last time I heard from her was when I got a letter from the prison she was in at the time. I'm 26 years old, and I have to focus on my own life and moving forward.\n\nIt's a heartbreaking thing, but the overwhelming concern, darkness, self-blame, etc. that comes with having that burden on your shoulders is soul shattering. There is only so much one person can do, and your job is to make the most out of your life. Don't fall into that pit, please.","id":"dp3vf8i","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1510333906},{"created_utc":1509389534,"subreddit":"relationships","author":"surprise_imback","parent_id":"79psks","link_id":"79psks","score":213,"body":">Honestly just want to change cities, change my name and phone number and never talk to any of them again.\n\nTbh, that's probably what a lot of people here are going to suggest, and it's exactly what you should do. Your father wants YOU to sacrifice your life for your addict brother, and sit back and watch as your life gets ruined and not his.

[19M] am at my wits end with my mum [49F], sister [27F] and dad's [57M] approach to dealing with a serious mice infestation.","selftext":"So we've had a mice infestation for around 18 months. At first, my mum bought some glue traps and poison food pellets to try to get rid of the mice. We only managed to catch one of them within the first month. I was still a bit skeptical because I'm sure mice don't appear individually, and not even a couple of weeks later, more started to pop up occasionally in the kitchen and in my room. Over the months they have disappeared and reappeared but what bothered me with my family is that for them, disappeared = no more mice in the home, but that obviously was never the case.\n\nI've constantly pushed them to call pest control but every time I bring it up, my mum's constant excuse is \"it's too much money\". Mind you, this is coming from the same woman who happily wanted to, and did, spend almost \u00a32000 for part of my tuition fee (which she didn't have to do because my loan was due a little while after the semester started and I was still able to attend classes). The same woman who can afford a brand new oven, but says it's way too expensive to call a professional to deal with a more serious issue. What makes it worse is that whenever I try to turn to my sister, she acts as if it's none of her business, and my dad says he'll do something about it but isn't any help either.\n\nWhat bothers me the most is the fact that whenever I bring up any issues, whether it be the mice or anything else, they all belittle my feelings and brush it off as no big deal. With this particular issue, I've told them that I feel extremely uncomfortable staying at home because I become extremely anxious due to the mice but still they belittle my feelings and brush them off. This angers me to no end and I'm contemplating packing my bags and returning back to my place, but the only thing stopping me is me wanting to see my friends and spend time with my girlfriend, and the fact that I have little money left to even buy a train ticket. This situation, along with countless others, has made me become increasingly distant with my family. I'm extremely angry with them but I have no clue what to do or how to fix it.\n\nTL;DR: Had a mice infestation in my home for around 18 months. Family has done nothing to deal with it. Mum refuses to call pest control due to 'it being too expensive' and rather buys shitty traps that don't work. Family constantly belittle my feelings about this situation and many other situations, and I very much want to pack my bags and go back to my place at uni, but I want to be with friends and girlfriend, and don't I have money for a ticket back anyway. Need help.","id":"5joc4x","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1484428914,"good_comments":[{"created_utc":1482379391,"subreddit":"relationships","author":"cardinal29","parent_id":"5joc4x","link_id":"5joc4x","score":11,"body":"They are being lackadaisical about the mice.

should I [27 F] deal with my relatives [various ages] who think I should gift them things all the time when I visit and send them money?","selftext":"This is a very delicate situation because I was born in the kind of culture of poor working class people in Eastern Europe with lots of family members who have gone to countries such as Canada, Ireland and Germany to earn a better living. When I was a kid, they'd sometimes come to vacation here and buy presents and give money because they were better off and could help their poorer family. It was expected by all parties as something that should happen. If the relatives didn't seem generous enough, everyone would gossip about it. And I mean, *everyone*, because my family is *huge*.\n\nI never really expected it and even felt guilty about being gifted things as a kid, but as I said, it's almost ingrained in the people here that this is The Way to Be.\n\nNow I'm fairly well off. I've lived with my boyfriend for years, and he also has a well paying job. Those financial expectations are now placed on us. I want to help out my family now and again, I want to give the kids things and make them happy. But I *know* it's expected of me, and I know what those people say when their richer relatives aren't generous enough. They're also generous people themselves and will often give the most of what they have and send you off with something from their garden, something they cooked, made, etc, so I feel selfish and guilty for not sharing enough of my wealth because they're not well off and still want to give me what they have. They're not all bad or toxic or horrible people.\n\nI know the usual advice here would be to tell them to fuck off and that they're not entitled to my money. They're not, but I don't want to alienate 40 people because they think I'm not a giver and that I'm selfish.\n\nI'm visiting family at the moment. Just today, I went shopping with my cousin and she straight up pushed a dress in my hands and told me to pay. My boyfriend and I already paid for gifts, a family gathering with a big feast of a dinner, a huge pile of groceries and more. My mom says people are already planning for us to pay for more. Without even consulting us. We know we're being exploited, but they think it's just being good family. Is there any way to get through to these people without burning bridges? I feel so guilty even though I know I shouldn't.\n\n**tl;dr**: I'm well off and my poor family asks for money a lot and I'm expected to lavish them with gifts while I'm visiting them. How can I establish boundaries without losing 40+ family members in the process?","id":"4keoir","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1466477188,"good_comments":[{"created_utc":1463857717,"subreddit":"relationships","author":"quinoa2013","parent_id":"4keoir","link_id":"4keoir","score":12,"body":"I think you need to learn to say no (especially to shopping trips).

Is it really worth it to keep a relationship with people who feel allienated and gossip behind your back just because you don't give them enough of your money? This is not a rethoric question, I am asking you honestly.\n\nIf you feel the value that your family as a whole adds to your life is worth it, if they are people who will be there for you in times of need, if they make you feel loved or whatever way you feel they should make you feel, then these bridges will probably be worth it.\n\nIf on the other hand you have the feeling that they only see you as an ATM, and that they don't really care about you, you should really cut ties with those people, even without this whole issue.\n\nIf I were you, I would give good gifts to the people of my family I am closest with, and the rest of people, (who have the callousnes to gossip behind my back!) could go and fuck themselves.\n\nBut this is easy to say for me because my culture allows it and there is not such an expectation.\n\nThink about how important keeping these people in your life is for you OP, that is the important

girlfriend (20F) does not feel accepted by my (22M) family","selftext":"For some context, me (22M) studying, doing a BSc in biochemical engineering, girlfriend (20F) studying, doing a BSc in nursing. Been together for three and half years.\n\nAll of my immediate family is very well educated within a very narrow scientific field. My parents, my two significantly older siblings (+7 and +5 years) and their spouses have either masters or Ph. D\u2019s in international law, social science, political science or anthropology (yay for wellfarestate). My entire family works within different governmental or NGO departments, all related to their fields.\n\nWhen we come together for birthdays, dinner parties and the likes, the main conversational topics pretty much always surround hardcore politics (we talk about normal stuff too, like the weather, movies, music, food and holidays, but it is definitely to a **much** lesser extent). Now, here\u2019s the issue\u2026 my girlfriend doesn\u2019t know or care that much about hardcore politics or international law. Naturally, this makes her feel unable to participate in pretty much all conversation. Therefore, she feels disregarded and like an illiterate idiot at every get-together with my family. Last time we went to a social event at my sisters\u2019 place, her exact words afterwards was \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m a mute, idiot, trophy girlfriend when we are with your family\u201d.\n\nMy girlfriend really wants to feel like an integrated part of the family, so she is really upset, about the fact that even though we have been together for so long, she still does not feel welcome or comfortable with my family. At this point, my girlfriend is beginning to form the opinion, that my family thinks that she is not good enough for me, because she does not know hardcore politics. This in return bums me out, a lot. The problem lies in the fact, that once my family has gone through standard small talk, and has asked my girlfriend about what is going on in her life, they really have very little in common, so conversation always switch right back into politics. My entire family loves my girlfriend, they are genuinely interested in her well-being, they invite us to different events and on holidays, get her Christmas and birthday presents. Honestly, they do their very best to include her in the family.\n\nSo, the big question is, how do I get my girlfriend to feel more as a part of my family?\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR;\\*\\* : Girlfriend feels academically inadequate, is beginning to believe that my family thinks she is no good for me.

But then when I asked if she knew about me and he said no (this was after a couple months), I started to become a little suspicious. Once he finally did tell her, her true intentions started coming out of the woodwork. She would constantly be telling him how she wishes things were different and that she'd always wait for him, etc. Always asking weird questions about me like if I believe in marriage, babies (their biggest problem was that she had a previous kid and wanted to get married, he didn't.) I confronted him about it and told him it'd be best if they remained friends, but if he could just politely tell her that she can't talk that way anymore because we are dating and that it is not fair to her fiance and I. He still hasn't, his reason being that he doesn't want to hurt her.\n\n--\n\nAnyway, the idea that her second child might be his has been entertained before; she sometimes uses it against him when he won't talk to her. When he told her they should do a paternity test she said he \"wasn't ready anyway, so what's the point?\" This leads me to believe she's bluffing, however as of recently she will text him pictures of the thing saying \"it's a shame we'll never know if she's yours, she's so sweet\" etc. I told him this *seriously* has to stop, but again, he just says he doesn't want to hurt her feelings and confront her.\n\nI really have no idea what to do here. I can't just force a swab into the babies mouth and send it in for testing myself but my god, these are two adults that are (or rather *aren't*) dealing with something very serious and they're both acting absolutely pathetic. I really don't think this girl realizes the hurt she is causing; i.e. she is engaged to the man who thinks this baby is his, and she is putting a strain on my boyfriend and I's relationship as well.\n\nTLDR; Boyfriend's ex-girlfriend still texts him she misses him after 2+ years, says she'll wait for him, suggests he is the father of her child, boyfriend won't confront her about it.","id":"1ngabc","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1442092778,"good_comments":[{"created_utc":1380569224,"subreddit":"relationships","author":"macimom","parent_id":"1ngabc","link_id":"1ngabc","score":16,"body":"1)  its not normal for someone in a relationship to keep texting their ex\n2) your bf should not hide your existence from his ex\n3) he cares more about 'not hurting' his ex's feelings (who, btw, is engaged?) then hurting your feelings\n4) he doesn't believe in marriage?\n5) he may be a father but won't get a test done (bc he is too lazy or just doesn't give a fuck?)\n\nwhy would you settle for such a crappy relationship-get out and find someone who is a little more mature","id":"ccicwzn","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1429291463},{"created_utc":1380563531,"subreddit":"relationships","author":"Sal002","parent_id":"1ngabc","link_id":"1ngabc","score":20,"body":"Your bf needs to cut contact and give her an ultimatum (paternity test or gtfo) or you need to get out while you can.

Trust me: that makes sex *soooo* much better.\n\nAnd if you want an extra layer of protection, pun intended, then don't cum inside them regardless of condom usage.","id":"cwt1m8w","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1449676803}],"split":"train","tokens":[{"context":[50257,2950,1274,7659,35742,50258,50259,21160,808,12,1854,50260,50263,2438,467,346,5462,619,1263,258,33792,31,50264,50265,41,1102,258,21773,358,22607,9,476,893,315,744,4426,341,2583,14,1407,327,315,837,471,1284,3191,33841,315,766,285,761,12,619,1263,258,33792,467,346,10974,982,346,822,2642,258,2577,394,816,346,992,2835,504,773,352,258,33792,31,50266,50267],"target":[293,891,356,346,424,263,33792,320,6106,12,346,461,10974,2642,263,2577,14,50268]},{"context":[50257,2950,1274,7659,35742,50258,50259,21160,808,12,1854,50260,50263,2438,467,346,5462,619,1263,258,33792,31,50264,50265,41,1102,258,21773,358,22607,9,476,893,315,744,4426,341,2583,14,1407,327,315,837,471,1284,3191,33841,315,766,285,761,12,619,1263,258,33792,467,346,10974,982,346,822,2642,258,2577,394,816,346,992,2835,504,773,352,258,33792,31,50266,50267],"target":[1027,339,1023,346,291,263,1049,327,346,822,352,14,315,461,692,2741,352,24027,1715,23640,41,14,10529,2643,352,585,3859,12,341,339,656,263,2100,327,315,1102,5386,352,14,844,429,319,617,1999,14,199,199,6944,1467,390,7478,352,10974,2230,2642,607,982,5763,258,33792,14,2774,390,408,14,199,199,8163,30814,5345,352,535,5213,8,83,9,8163,14,1321,1596,471,1613,853,478,1843,89,13,68,660,89,394,4233,612,327,339,408,645,332,7,440,766,12,476,10997,14,9871,503,26,327,1839,1715,1636,569,34161,10,882,1366,14,199,199,1871,612,346,766,282,3132,7680,287,4801,12,4001,5293,12,789,837,471,10974,2642,607,7693,287,33792,8749,14,50268]}],"length":44},{"created_utc":1531231628,"subreddit":"NoStupidQuestions","author":"PizzaIsItsOwnReward","num_comments":3,"score":30,"title":"Do the calories in a slice of bacon decline after you pan fry it?","selftext":"I've always wondered this.

I work as a furniture mover\/installer and I'm the skinniest guy in the company. There are some guys there that go to the gym regularly and have a lot of muscle, but I've noticed that some of these guys can barely even lift a heavy console table or a sleeper sofa without having to put it down. I get chosen very frequently to take their place because i have no trouble doing it, yet I'm very skinny with little muscle to show. I've been doing physical labor my entire life (age 22) a of it being hard shit. Am i just built this way to do things?

Moving furniture requires you to balance it properly while walking, which is a skill in itself. Also, it's possible that they only do exercises that do not use the motions you use when moving heavy things, so they can't lift a couch without throwing out their backs even though they can squat the weight of the couch in a Smith machine, for example.\n\nPersonally, I got better at carrying heavy things after lifting weights for a long while. I can carry a fifteen-kilo dumbbell in my hands, but I can't carry a fifteen-kilo box because I have to hold it in a very inefficient way. When you lift a weight, you just stand and lift, but when you carry a box, you also have to make sure you're not tripping over the stairs, that the box isn't tipping forward out of your hands, and a box is harder to grip than a bar.\n\nAnd you may be skinny, but you're probably all muscle. Plus, there's different types of muscle for different types of motion - someone who can lift lighter weights over and over for a very long time is going to look different from the person who can lift something very heavy once.\n\nBy the way, does your username contain the word 'mamaliga', or corn porridge, or am I breaking it into words incorrectly?","id":"e2fvq46","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1536093659},{"created_utc":1531680176,"subreddit":"NoStupidQuestions","author":"FloydMaywether","parent_id":"8z3qz1","link_id":"8z3qz1","score":79,"body":"Yes there\u2019s different types of muscle fibers just like why marathon runners and sprinters are 2 completely different animals with different training programs.\n\nLifting weights rep ranges:\nFor explosive- 1-3 reps\n\nStrength (powerlifting)3-5 reps\nHypertrophy (bodybuilding)- 8-12 reps\nEndurance- (CrossFit, sport specific) 15+ reps.\n\nYour coworkers are probably just bodybuilders.

Do you take your shampoo etc with you or do you share with your, uh, friend? What about the washing cloth?

do we believe in science?","selftext":"What makes people *believe* in science? Some would argue that using that word is wrong, but ultimately, doesn't every single person have to believe in whatever a scientist or an expert says to a certain extent? I mean, I don't think there is somebody that can demonstrate every single scientifically established fact in all disciplines. So this makes me ask, what makes us so blindly trusting of scientific consensus?\n\nDoesn't every scientific bit of knowledge start from a set of axioms that are considered self-evidently true? As in, saying that A is *always* A(I don't mean this as in a change of state - from A to B, but as in A being in two states simultaneously). Because if things were otherwise, a lot of facts just wouldn't be, well, facts anymore. Isn't this just like believing in God's existence and developing your entire train of thought from that one axiom that is so indisputably true?\n\nI'm asking this from a genuine point of ignorance, since epistemology and philosophy of science were never my forte, nor do I know proper authors or the like, but there are always people who like to bash you for saying *scientific beliefs*. Another thing: I'm not mainly disputing theories and hypotheses, but also facts. Why do we know *for certain* that the results of a certain experiment will *always* be that way? Do I misunderstand the use of *fact*? An indisputably true entity? If yes, why is it indisputably true? Our own perception of something? Because we often perceive things wrong. So can machines. I realize this is a lot of philosophical skepticism and people are very reluctant of that, which makes me ask another question: apart from pragmatism, why is philosophical skepticism so hated by so many today?\n\nAs an ending note, I unironically want to apologize for my English. As in, I might have misunderstood certain terms because of cognates or something along that line.","id":"aakqwc","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1548982208,"good_comments":[{"created_utc":1546088332,"subreddit":"NoStupidQuestions","author":"StigOfTheTrack","parent_id":"aakqwc","link_id":"aakqwc","score":34,"body":"You seem slightly confused about what science actually *is*.\n\nScience isn't a set of rules about the universe. Science is a methodology for finding a useful set of rules.\n\nThe core of science is:\n\n* Make an observation that something happens\n* Form a hypothesis about why that thing happens\n* Devise an experiment to test that hypothesis\n* Accept, reject or revise the hypothesis\n\nThe whole point is that our model about how the universe works is subject to constant scrutiny and can and will be revised\/refined as we spot exceptions. The most important phrase in science isn't \"eureka\", its \"that's odd\". This is why the word belief isn't really appropriate, that is for other things where \"it is written, therefore it is true\" is the norm.\n\nNow on a daily basis we do treat certain models as if they're true is because they've been found to be a useful model which allows for useful predictions. They may not be quite right, but they're so near as makes no practical difference they'll do until we find something better. Even with something more accurate an older model might still be useful (e.g. Newton's laws of motion are still good enough for most everyday stuff, even though Einstein's theory of relativity tells us they don't apply in extreme cases - so long as we know the limits we're fine to use the simpler model).","id":"ecsthq7","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1548222046},{"created_utc":1546085704,"subreddit":"NoStupidQuestions","author":"ivanhaversham","parent_id":"aakqwc","link_id":"aakqwc","score":73,"body":"We believe in science because it can be proven.

I look, people are either married, in a relationship, or constantly at least dating. What am I missing here? Why does this concept seem so difficult to me?","selftext":"First off, I know the sidebar says not to ask \"Will I ever get a girlfriend?\"\n\nThis is not that question, so don't delete it.\n\nI'm a sociable guy. I've got friends. I go out and hang out 2-3 times a week.\n\nAnd yet CONSTANTLY, everywhere I look, it seems like everyone is either married, in a relationship, or consistently dating and finding new potential prospects. Even super shy, nerdy, socially-awkward people. Even people who live in tiny towns and therefore have almost no one to pick from to date or marry.\n\nHow do all these people seem to find a person SO easily, and be SO happy with them? Is everyone just settling for someone they're not truly in love with and then trying to make it work? I don't get it.\n\nOn a good week, I might meet two or three new people. One or two of those will be girls. Usually they are already in a relationship or married.\n\nLet's say once every few weeks I meet a girl who isn't in a relationship or married. There's a 50\/50 chance they are friendly and interesting enough to consider consistently hanging out with. (Let's be honest, some people you just don't click with on any level right off the bat). But then beyond just being friendly and interesting, what are the odds that you would be truly compatible to this person, attracted to them, they're attracted to you, and you would be able to make it work as a real relationship? The odds are astronomical.\n\nSo I'm not trying to ask, \"Will I ever get a girlfriend?\" I'm trying to ask, \"Is it something about my mindset or everyday situation that makes the concept of consistently dating seem so foreign to me? If it's constantly happening ALL around me in MASSIVE numbers, there must be something that's just not clicking in my brain. What is it?\"","id":"47gz6w","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1459214227,"good_comments":[{"created_utc":1456371645,"subreddit":"NoStupidQuestions","author":"AmericanDerp","parent_id":"47gz6w","link_id":"47gz6w","score":22,"body":"> But then beyond just being friendly and interesting, what are the odds that you would be truly compatible to this person, attracted to them, they're attracted to you, and you would be able to make it work as a real relationship? The odds are astronomical.\n\nI think this is your problem. You're overthinking things. Go date. Go hang out. Go make out. Go fuck.\n\nDon't try to find a soul mate. Don't try to find a perfect match. Dating is like going to the shoe store, or the department store. Try on everything. See what fits. Maybe you think -- I'm a navy suit guy, and I like brown shoes. So you try on every shade of blue and every brown wingtip you can find and you're like, hey, this is right.\n\nBut then one day in a Macy's or Nordstrom, you notice a black suit, and you're like, well, that's a cute suit. But it doesn't do much for me. But I need to try one, so. Well, hey, this is OK. It fits. I'll try it tomorrow. It's *ok*. Oh, wait. I like this. The material is a good fit for this humidity. Oh, I feel ok wearing this. Eh, I like navy.\n\nSuddenly it's four years later, and you only wear black suits. You think to yourself, I should upgrade and get this one black suit tailored. You tell the tailor, I'll -- wait for it -- *ring you* for my order.\n\nSuddenly you and the black suit are popping out cufflinks.\n\nThe best relationships just sort of *happen*. Try to be zen about and roll with it and circumstances and relationships. I used to try hard. As soon as I stopped giving a shit I met the love of my life. It took me give or take two or three serious relationship tries (depending on how I count any given day) and at least a few dozen rounds of dating deliberately. Then I met my BFF and spouse randomly in a bar mixed into a group of friends. Friends of friends, and away we go. You just have to be willing to turn off your brain on it all at times and let the wind take you where it will.","id":"d0cv0o3","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1458723704}],"split":"train","tokens":[{"context":[50257,2950,1274,7659,35742,50258,50259,21817,1680,12,1585,50260,50263,6110,3004,315,805,12,662,390,2036,6406,12,288,258,2777,12,394,7559,380,1552,10692,14,1868,717,315,4815,995,31,4163,858,429,3722,1284,524,2409,285,503,31,50264,50265,5963,573,12,315,761,263,40218,1140,408,285,1266,367,8744,315,1684,652,258,11078,1702,199,199,1213,319,408,327,1809,12,524,837,471,12234,341,14,199,199,41,1102,258,1308,3380,3517,14,315,1054,1393,2461,14,315,468,504,291,8182,504,363,13,19,1662,258,1286,14,199,199,1871,1866,7103,2258,8644,11320,12,8348,315,805,12,341,2332,589,2507,319,2036,6406,12,288,258,2777,12,394,9836,10692,291,4918,650,2786,13286,14,3413,2209,15801,12,17157,9893,12,18119,13,708,12379,662,14,3413,662,509,2108,288,7010,11685,291,4362,424,2049,646,531,285,2299,423,285,3129,394,12480,14,199,199,2438,467,478,778,662,1284,285,1065,258,1049,12810,3539,12,291,308,12810,3773,352,607,31,1149,2507,656,25447,330,2131,485,822,408,4989,288,1843,352,291,789,2112,285,788,341,671,31,315,837,471,652,341,14,199,199,2203,258,923,1286,12,315,1245,1827,735,394,1116,650,662,14,1882,394,735,287,884,482,308,4814,14,19673,485,390,1542,288,258,2777,394,6406,14,199,199,5757,339,911,1753,791,1179,2746,315,1827,258,2577,509,2126,471,288,258,2777,394,6406,14,1319,339,258,2027,15,1121,2864,485,390,8031,291,3500,1577,285,2075,9836,10939,504,352,14,358,5757,339,308,5509,12,618,662,346,656,837,471,3905,352,320,598,1242,827,573,263,7366,738,888,789,3676,656,853,8031,291,3500,12,645,390,263,10403,327,346,562,308,4989,11671,285,429,1049,12,12726,285,607,12,485,822,12726,285,346,12,291,346,562,308,1499,285,788,341,671,356,258,1104,2777,31,384,10403,390,37210,14,199,199,2397,315,1102,408,2112,285,1266,12,367,8744,315,1684,652,258,11078,1702,315,1102,2112,285,1266,12,367,3793,341,1224,547,617,20528,394,10909,3075,327,1839,263,3722,287,9836,10692,1284,524,3216,285,503,31,1003,341,339,7559,5837,11097,1089,503,288,338,10706,9307,3147,12,613,1277,308,1224,327,339,656,408,12265,288,617,3633,14,1868,319,341,1702,50266,50267],"target":[30,888,789,3676,656,853,8031,291,3500,12,645,390,263,10403,327,346,562,308,4989,11671,285,429,1049,12,12726,285,607,12,485,822,12726,285,346,12,291,346,562,308,1499,285,788,341,671,356,258,1104,2777,31,384,10403,390,37210,14,199,199,41,893,429,319,535,1918,14,922,822,626,28974,1244,14,1515,3129,14,1515,8182,504,14,1515,788,504,14,1515,5090,14,199,199,3988,471,1950,285,1065,258,5849,16134,14,2095,471,1950,285,1065,258,2819,2873,14,43529,319,589,1017,285,263,17293,3651,12,394,263,5012,3651,14,9994,320,2280,14,4092,645,11415,14,6675,346,893,1378,315,1102,258,23957,6051,3517,12,291,315,589,7587,10013,14,1407,346,1950,320,791,17980,287,4172,291,791,7587,8540,22505,346,461,1065,291,346,822,589,12,17208,12,429,319,827,14,199,199,1538,789,531,1111,288,258,50049,339,394,18688,20283,12,346,4004,258,2043,6051,12,291,346,822,589,12,881,12,327,339,258,13780,6051,14,888,341,1596,471,467,882,330,503,14,888,315,762,285,1950,531,12,524,14,3895,12,17208,12,429,319,7478,14,633,11415,14,315,1184,1950,341,9440,14,633,339,1636,483,24621,3967,12,4044,14,315,589,429,14,384,2588,319,258,923,4198,330,429,27717,14,3967,12,315,1255,12877,5763,429,14,31481,12,315,589,23957,14,199,199,38583,341,339,1441,813,1569,12,291,346,692,5807,2043,14804,14,922,893,285,3512,12,315,816,8516,291,652,429,531,2043,6051,27572,14,922,1561,263,35281,12,315,1184,1378,4044,330,341,1378,1636,1807,346,10,330,617,1503,14,199,199,38583,346,291,263,2043,6051,390,26325,504,47292,28752,14,199,199,465,1267,6959,656,3298,287,1636,72,1325,269,24621,9994,285,308,1977,269,547,291,4837,352,341,291,5918,291,6959,14,315,974,285,1950,1328,14,1082,2583,356,315,5026,3502,258,7511,315,1139,263,1843,287,617,1205,14,633,1719,503,1578,394,1012,735,394,1116,2727,2777,8405,358,44024,320,704,315,955,598,1814,1111,9,291,380,1552,258,1179,8668,9197,287,10692,14594,14,3245,315,1139,617,348,5778,291,16732,15457,288,258,2319,7669,657,258,1449,287,2461,14,14214,287,2461,12,291,1498,357,468,14,922,656,424,285,308,4685,285,1211,573,535,3633,320,341,478,380,1662,291,1310,263,2345,1012,346,811,341,482,14,50268]}],"length":311},{"created_utc":1549789862,"subreddit":"NoStupidQuestions","author":"3001038m","num_comments":24,"score":37,"title":"Please help me help this little man.","selftext":"So my girlfriend has an autistic son he just turned 5. Also this is my first time I\u2019ve actually been around a special needs child. I mean honestly if he could express his needs you wouldn\u2019t even know he has autism. He\u2019s the coolest little dude ever he\u2019s a really sweet kid. So it upsets me when he gets so frustrated not being able to express himself. He used to scream and kick the door when he wanted in a room. But I got him to start saying \u201copen door\u201d and now he doesn\u2019t kick the door or scream. If he gets frustrated with a toy or if it goes under\/behind the couch I\u2019ve gotten him to start asking for help instead of just screaming at the top of his lungs. But today we went to the aquarium and he tried jumping in the tank with the sea turtles and every other thing with an open tank. He screamed every time we told him no. He doesn\u2019t get that you just can\u2019t jump into shark tanks lol. But is there any way that I can teach him how to talk. He tries so hard when he isn\u2019t getting told he can\u2019t do something he\u2019s always trying to hold conversation with this little baby noises. I always try and engage back. He\u2019s so ready to speak and he knows it too. Besides Help, Stop, No, Please, and Thank You. He doesn\u2019t really have to big of a vocabulary. Idk I\u2019m dragging on here. If anyone can help me help him it would be greatly appreciated. I feel like a lot of people gave up on him to include his dad. I feel like maybe with a positive male role model in his life this dude can do great things. If his dad were around and actually cared about him he\u2019d probably be holding full blown conversations and would be able to dress himself without needing help. He doesn\u2019t necessarily struggle with that either. He just gets frustrated when he can\u2019t get his arm in the last sleeve on a long sleeve shirt. But still he\u2019s come leaps and bounds since I\u2019ve met him and I really just need some advice. I also get to not rush anything and kind of let him come to things on his own.

So we just moved around to another section but she just followed us to the sand box and threw sand at us, at which point i felt defeted and took my niece and left.\n\nA few weeks ago a simillar thing happened, but after i told the bully that he didnt own the playground, the parent(who watched the kid try and push past myself and my niece to camp on the slide and prevent us from using it) she got in my face for telling her bastard offspring to share bc \"he doesnt have to share shit if he doesnt want to\" then she took her hellspawn to leave before \"she slapped this bitch upside his face\"\n\nDo i call the police, and what do they do with an unruly and rude child.","id":"4yf66y","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1473058763,"good_comments":[{"created_utc":1471561457,"subreddit":"NoStupidQuestions","author":"itty53","parent_id":"4yf66y","link_id":"4yf66y","score":49,"body":"Honestly I thought the \"call the police\" question at the end was like 'whoa, calm down' until I read the whole thing.\n\nIn the circumstance of your kid being attacked by another and their parent defending that attack, call the police. That's assault, no matter how petty. If the parents want to play like spoiled little loitering children, treat them like it. Call the cops on them. Force them to be inconvenienced by it and to deal with it, otherwise they'll just do it again the next day. Make them pay for bad parenting.\n\nIn the second case, if we're talking about a five year old unsupervised (I'd say this applies up to about age 10), call the police *faster*. Different reasoning though: You're not out to punish the child, you're protecting them. A child like that out and about without supervision has a pretty bad home-life. If they won't listen to you, they'll listen to the cops, and even if they don't, it won't be you assaulting the kid. This might be a bit controversial given the \"free range kids\" movement, but the fact is that the parents are legally responsible for their kids' actions, regardless of their awareness of them. If a kid is breaking the law, he'll keep doing it until someone punishes him for it.\n\n[You can find more opinions on this topic here](http:\/\/parenting.stackexchange.com\/questions\/5165\/how-do-you-handle-unsupervised-poorly-behaved-children-in-public-play-areas)","id":"d6naygq","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1473481769}],"split":"train","tokens":[{"context":[50257,2950,1274,7659,35742,50258,50259,17909,1249,12,1585,50260,50263,2438,467,315,3032,619,282,556,16669,16150,1201,7128,617,41804,380,258,1172,24818,31,50264,50265,8889,1313,1719,617,41804,8,18,1223,258,353,15,18,9,285,258,24818,1475,617,2157,291,546,4965,608,12081,320,3405,291,1313,4137,330,608,619,618,1311,866,266,3864,643,813,1469,2059,511,291,428,5242,608,14,315,1298,608,408,285,38333,585,3989,291,327,613,319,1577,2120,320,263,24818,330,2507,14,1376,3115,827,380,503,291,31214,617,41804,291,1298,503,327,367,7092,461,467,4233,674,3383,781,546,408,608,1996,1821,1601,789,674,7122,617,41804,867,291,12166,4899,355,2420,380,608,14,199,199,1859,548,430,598,585,6491,1089,12,656,258,1179,4698,1752,2193,1089,808,13,941,813,1469,476,263,866,266,775,2577,42548,1284,285,308,352,598,287,607,12,394,598,287,263,585,6491,380,263,3953,14,1082,882,356,1313,2228,285,4269,4830,608,657,1307,1286,285,767,704,674,8289,853,33633,417,2131,5750,12,1313,374,430,547,285,1908,258,643,615,1469,12,476,1313,42548,766,285,16867,617,300,495,729,1111,380,263,3953,2036,417,4306,14,1407,357,656,3889,1089,285,1195,2666,476,674,656,3941,515,285,263,6451,3092,291,9618,6451,380,515,12,380,544,967,1313,2937,826,317,277,291,1719,617,41804,291,1365,14,199,199,33,1179,2746,2085,258,986,360,284,1518,3023,12,476,707,1313,1298,263,27411,327,340,42548,899,263,24818,12,263,2561,8,8728,7343,263,5142,1950,291,4575,1614,3590,291,617,41804,285,1414,320,263,10650,291,2949,515,423,1263,341,9,674,1393,288,617,1987,330,5150,608,31031,20792,285,2649,47126,367,259,46702,424,285,2649,7511,612,340,46702,766,285,2,789,674,1719,608,5969,48184,285,2667,879,367,7092,31214,429,21552,17197,466,1987,2,199,199,5212,1313,870,263,1645,12,291,645,467,485,467,352,282,556,34716,291,22067,1201,14,50266,50267],"target":[40818,315,1808,263,367,13346,263,1645,2,1809,380,263,887,374,589,706,8728,65,12,9481,867,7,1567,315,1101,263,2188,1518,14,199,199,819,263,25180,287,535,5142,853,7385,417,1195,291,512,2561,11750,327,1369,12,870,263,1645,14,1321,339,4642,12,646,2301,704,25230,14,1003,263,3398,766,285,712,589,34782,1311,2377,271,1587,1752,12,2191,607,589,341,14,4890,263,14074,320,607,14,5222,607,285,308,20489,26344,417,341,291,285,1731,352,341,12,4307,485,1184,656,467,341,758,263,1307,1111,14,6890,607,1415,330,2090,26175,14,199,199,819,263,1219,1340,12,612,357,822,3376,547,258,1937,615,1469,556,16669,16150,358,41,1550,911,429,8992,511,285,547,2480,839,829,870,263,1645,1636,70,1604,24621,20616,14608,997,26,922,822,408,504,285,6879,263,1201,12,346,822,10193,607,14,318,1201,589,327,504,291,547,1232,20866,469,258,2496,2090,1364,13,6043,14,1003,485,1840,471,6005,285,346,12,485,1184,6005,285,263,14074,12,291,773,612,485,837,471,12,341,1840,471,308,346,31541,263,5142,14,771,1245,308,258,1644,8382,1814,263,367,5788,2838,3989,2,3357,12,476,263,1110,319,327,263,3398,390,11120,4498,330,512,3989,7,4029,12,7693,287,512,9360,287,607,14,1003,258,5142,319,7164,263,1100,12,340,1184,1395,1805,341,1567,2131,4001,5615,684,330,341,14,199,199,59,1640,461,1065,518,9318,320,429,7244,995,16152,4024,1379,8001,279,14,302,331,366,88,3804,14,786,15,6139,508,15,21,20987,15,4920,13,4599,13,5833,13,28145,13,404,16669,16150,13,36673,307,13,20710,9587,13,17198,13,260,13,11378,13,1760,13,534,293,9,50268]}],"length":306},{"created_utc":1539273381,"subreddit":"NoStupidQuestions","author":"DrunkenlySober","num_comments":98,"score":68,"title":"How have people been ok\/still are ok with the current work\/life balance?","selftext":"I\u2019ve just graduated university and stepped into the corporate world and I am officially the most miserable I have ever been.

mothers in-law's dog attacked and mauled my 9 month old daughter... And she took the dog's side.","selftext":"Two days ago, my daughter and I were playing on the  living room floor. She was a little farther than arms reach from me. The dog, a 22 lb Sheltie, was about 7 or 8 feet away. I heard a noise and looked up to see the dog charging my daughter. He grabbed her by the face and began to viciously shake her. He wouldn't let go until, I ran over and kicked him. I picked her up and her eye was pouring blood, she had multiple other bite marks all over her face and head. I ran her upstairs where her dad and my mother in law were. When her dad saw what happened, he ran down, picked up the dog and threw him outside. His mother began immediately screaming for HIM to get out of her house for what he did to the dog! We rushed my daughter to the er. By luck, the teeth marks around her eye missed her eye by about a centimeter. She was still injured pretty badly, but I am haunted by how bad it could've been.\n\nAfter we got home, his mother told us that it \"wasn't fair to the dog\" for us to stay there. And, the dog doesn't deserve to be reprimanded for what he did to HER granddaughter. I feel I must had that my daughter was NO WHERE near the dog when he attacked. She didn't accidentally pull on his fur so he snapped at her. She wasn't playing near his food dish or with any of his toys. This dog charged her and mauled her completely unprovoked.\n\nSo, the advice I'm asking for... Am I wrong to feel completely betrayed by this woman? Is it wrong to feel like that dog deserves to be put down for mauling my child? Her grandmother has basically told me it was my fault, the baby's fault, and made it clear that she believes its not the dog's fault. So, I need to know... What do I do now?","id":"5guary","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1484311224,"good_comments":[{"created_utc":1481048000,"subreddit":"Advice","author":"leyebrow","parent_id":"5guary","link_id":"5guary","score":82,"body":"You are absolutely not wrong to be infuriated by this. No 9 month old can be held responsible for their actions, HOWEVER, a 9-month-old should be supervised at all times (including the second you looked away) when around dogs. HOWEVER, if the owner (mother in law) had any concerns about the dog, she should have locked him up away from the child.\n\nIt is absolutely understandable to be upset at this woman. I would personally not allow your daughter to go over to her house after this incident - at least while the dog is around. I would say it's wrong, but understandable that you'd want the dog put down. It's obviously a horrible attack, but it's probably because the dog was not properly introduced to children, may have had bad experiences with them, and for all you know, may have been somehow instigated or fearful of your daughter. With proper ownership, just by simply keeping a distance between this dog and children, the dog can live a safe and happy life without hurting anyone.\n\nI WOULD, however, report this incident to the police so they have a record on file of this bite.","id":"dav3y9a","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1483523178},{"created_utc":1481053429,"subreddit":"Advice","author":"Mrs_MeowPuffs","parent_id":"5guary","link_id":"5guary","score":89,"body":"I wouldn't have my mom or MIL around my child after that.

If anyone thinks I'm not being truthful about my daughter not being near the dog, you are wrong. My daughter and I were playing on the floor, as I already said. The dog was no where near us. He charged her from across the room. This was an UNPROVOKED attack. There's no reading between the lines on that. These are FACTS. Not my own fictional version of what happened.","id":"davqbha","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1483533996},{"created_utc":1481071914,"subreddit":"Advice","author":"GreenHatSam","parent_id":"5guary","link_id":"5guary","score":23,"body":"Your MIL should *never* get to see your daughter again. *Ever*.\n\nI'm glad she disowned your husband.

I'm so sorry to hear that this happened. Before I make any suggestions on what to do, let me first say that it sounds like you are entirely justified in feeling the way that you do. From what you have described, your mother-in-law's reaction is completely out of sync with what happened. In her mind, she probably doesn't view it as a betrayal, but that doesn't make her reaction any less wrong.\n\nThat said...\n\nFirst things first, take pictures of the wounds. Also, make sure to keep paper copies of **all** the medical bills (exams, rabies shot, medicine, etc.), even if your insurance covers it.\n\nNext, you need to take a moment to sit down and think about what you want to happen. Depending on the state of your relationship with your daughter's father, you may also want to involve him in this decision. Do you just want the medical bills covered? Do you want the dog put down? These are things you will need to have clearly decided, because it will determine what you do next.\n\nTechnically, I believe you are legally responsible for reporting a dog attack. A lot of people don't like to do this because it can result in the dog being put down. But if you do not report this, realize that you are risking a repeat incident. Unfortunately, dogs that bite will\n\nrepeat the behavior if they are not properly taught to do otherwise. (Keep in mind, that I am referring to intentional biting. Accidental bites are a different ball game, but that's not relevant in this case.)\n\nIf you only want the medical bills covered, then you will have to talk to the person who is responsible for the dog: your mother-in-law. It's possible that she will be willing to cover the bills with no argument, and it's possible that she won't. I don't know her, so I can't say how she will react, but from what you've said, she doesn't want to take responsibility. And if she decides to be stubborn about it, you may have to take legal action.\n\nIf you want the dog to be reported, you may or may not want to talk to your mother-in-law before taking action. This could very well have a negative effect on your relationship with her, after all. However, I believe you would be completely justified--really, I believe you would be fulfilling your duty as a responsible citizen--to report the dog attack. Just realize that reporting the dog attack will probably result in the dog being put down. Again, I feel like this would be the right thing to do, but it will ultimately be your decision.\n\nFinally: Please make sure to give your mother-in-law at least some time to act on her own. She clearly has a strong emotional attachment to this dog. She is probably extremely upset about the entire issue, and this may be clouding her judgment. It would be a kindness to give her the chance to deal with this on her own terms. At the same time, you don't want to wait too long. Again, maybe talk to some people to figure out how much time is reasonable. That way, in the case that your mother-in-law does not come around, you'll know when to take action.","id":"dav4jjj","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1483523461},{"created_utc":1481063942,"subreddit":"Advice","author":"littlebunnyblue","parent_id":"5guary","link_id":"5guary","score":63,"body":"Go no contact *immediately*.

around store because I\u2019m black","selftext":"Hi guys, (I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ve posted this in the right place, sorry if not)\n\nSo today I (32f) went into a popular clothing store and immediately felt eyes burning into the back of my head. I turn round and see a young sales assistant standing in the next isle peeping through the clothes and just watching me. I was with my mum and my 3 small children, 2 of which were in a double buggy. We were shopping for a school bag for my eldest who will start school in September. I am mixed race and so are my children. I couldn\u2019t quite believe it at first so I went round into the next isle and she just sort of stood there like a deer in headlights and started fumbling with the clothes rack. I didn\u2019t say anything to her because I just felt humiliated and instead put back my things and started to walk out. On the way out I see another young girl just standing a few isles away watching me leave. Not in a subtle way but just stood there watching me as I walked by. I\u2019m not the confrontational type so I just walked out.\n\nThis has happened to me a few times in this store but I never actually address the issue with staff members or management I just walk away. I\u2019m also not sure whether they are being instructed to do this by management or if they\u2019re being trained to, but either way it\u2019s not acceptable. I know they discriminate because of the colour of my skin because every other person in the store was white and some had children in pushchairs but they were not followed or watched by several members of staff.\n\nThere have been times when I\u2019d go home and cry about it because I just feel so embarrassed and humiliated that someone would just look at me and my children and think to themselves \u201cyeah they look like the type that would steal from us\u201d. I\u2019ve never stolen a thing in my life. So today I filed a complaint with the companies head office and asked them to review the cctv footage to prove my point.

Some people are racist and some stores\/businesses\/organizations have policies which are racist, and that *sucks*. It really does. It shouldn't happen and it still does, and that sucks. And I am sorry that the existence of this prejudice is affecting you.\n\nYou shouldn't have to go into a store with your kids and worry that people are going to stereotype you. No one should.\n\nI *will* tell you, and hopefully it will be somewhat comforting, but probably not, that racism isn't the only type of stereotyping which happens in retail stores.\n\nI'm a *big* girl. Short, but obese. I could name 22 clothing stores off the top of my head where, when I walk in, I get those same stares. People following me around and sneering\/whispering.\n\nI am actually mixed race, but I look white. My son is mixed race, and looks half-black... and I get judgmental stares from people who make assumptions about \"white girls with mixed kids\".\n\nOr sometimes just for being a parent with the audacity to bring a child out in public at all.\n\nOr because my kid does something weird (autism, yay!) and they are judging of that.\n\nOver a decade ago, before I had my son, I was super poor. I still got those looks, based on nothing more than the quality of my clothing.\n\nOr maybe the way I carried myself.\n\nSee, when you've gone somewhere and gotten those looks... and then you have to go there (or a similar place) again ... it's instinct to try to protect yourself. To hunch your shoulders and duck your head, and to you (and me, and whoever is going through it at the time) all you know is you're worried or scared, or maybe you're pissed off and just *done* with it.\n\nOr instead of hunching over we adopt this sort of bravado, get loud, and laugh a little too hard, and strut.\n\nAnd neither of those responses is how the general public tends to walk through a store. So it *looks* suspicious to employees. And from past experience we assume it's because of... whyever it was that we got those looks the first time. Which makes us feel worse. And the cycle repeats.\n\n> Is there anything more I can do about it?\n\nThere is. You shouldn't need to do any of these things, and you certainly don't *have* to, but if you want to be part of the solution, if you want to do more, you can.\n\nFirst and foremost, continue reporting it when you feel you've been discriminated against. *Always* go through the proper channels and try to control your temper when you complain. When you get too emotional on a call like that, the person on the other end tends to think \"no wonder\" the employee did... whatever they did. Don't fight for their cause, fight for your own.\n\nSecond, ...and maybe this is more important. Don't be a victim. Don't be an asshole and *claim* it's just not being a victim either! But don't be a victim.\n\nWhen you go in a store don't let yourself worry about what people *might* think\/say. Don't worry if they're going to judge or discriminate or follow you. Walk through that store with your head held high like you have just as much right to be there as anyone else.\n\nAnd when someone does behave the way the people in this store behaved, don't let them *chase you out*. You see someone watching you and put your stuff down and walk out... they assume they caught you trying to steal and you left cause you got caught. It's a guilt response and you have nothing to feel guilty about.\n\nNext time you march those purchases right up to the register. If you don't want to give your business to the store, don't buy them. But don't just run away either. Take your stuff up to the register, and *tell them* you aren't buying any of it... and *why* you aren't.\n\nDon't throw a fit about it. Calm, matter-of-fact voice, like you're telling someone the time. And then leave on your *own* terms.\n\nOr address the person who's in the wrong. \"Excuse me, is there a reason you're following me?\"\n\nMaybe you'll get lucky and find out you were wrong. It's unlikely but possible. Some stores have different color baskets to show you'd like assistance. Some *people* tend to think parents *need* help. Some people are just judgey assholes, idk. And if they *are* in the wrong, they'll either say something incriminating or sneer and leave you alone. Either way you've got something to add to your complaint, without adding fuel to the fire.\n\nThird, keep talking about it. Share your experiences. Write coherent reviews and post stories like this online, and tell friends\/relatives where this happened, and if you *can*... take your business elsewhere.\n\nFinally... unfortunately dirty looks and stares aren't illegal. You can't prove harm or intention to cause harm from a look. I know it feels awful, but it's just not something we can cite in the current legal system. But if someone says something discriminatory and\/or kicks you out of their place of business without cause, you might have a case against them.\n\nPrivate businesses which provide services to the public cannot legal discriminate based on your race. It's a really tricky and intricate thing (example of a brief, incomplete \"plain english\" explanation: https:\/\/www.legalzoom.com\/articles\/the-right-to-refuse-service-can-a-business-refuse-service-to-someone-because-of-appearance ) but if you can prove (and that's why we talk to the employee!) that you were refused service, or treated poorly because of your race, there is something you can do. You'd have to discuss that with an attorney though. Sometimes there are free consultations at legal aid clinics, and there's a subreddit here... I think it's \/r\/legaladvice ?\n\nUnfortunately in the scenario you described here, I don't think there are any further steps available. It's up to the business management or owners to deal with. If it's a big corporation, you could call corporate as well, but aside from that, no immediate solutions come to mind.\n\nSo... I'll just wrap up by saying: Don't let those people control your emotions. You can choose to let this bring you down, or to let it slip away like nothing, or even to use it to pull yourself up. It's *your* choice. Your thoughts and your feelings are your own.\n\nAnd you don't deserve to be brought down. You deserve to be happy and comfortable. Please choose to treat yourself accordingly. :)\n\nMuch love and luck <3","id":"euqt7zy","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1572773051}],"split":"test","tokens":[{"context":[50257,22857,502,50258,50259,16158,1988,12,13131,50260,50263,7156,277,1089,3651,781,315,448,248,77,2043,50264,50265,17251,3731,12,358,41,448,248,77,7726,315,448,248,304,4482,429,288,263,827,1296,12,7927,612,408,9,199,199,2397,1910,315,358,2625,70,9,1817,657,258,2969,9529,3651,291,3394,2937,2952,9483,657,263,737,287,617,1183,14,315,1211,2836,291,767,258,1863,4201,8797,5056,288,263,1307,319,294,614,7214,833,263,8243,291,656,4965,503,14,315,374,352,617,25683,291,617,514,1403,1752,12,363,287,544,548,288,258,4275,46543,14,776,548,9736,330,258,1525,6132,330,617,34332,509,482,924,1525,288,2694,14,315,717,7669,3235,291,524,390,617,1752,14,315,3522,448,248,84,2408,1976,341,380,718,524,315,1817,2836,657,263,1307,319,294,291,674,656,3298,287,6205,613,589,258,20097,288,46784,291,2068,278,14740,352,263,8243,19128,14,315,1423,448,248,84,911,1998,285,608,781,315,656,2937,42660,291,2428,1235,737,617,1244,291,2068,285,2514,504,14,1551,263,836,504,315,767,1195,1863,2577,656,5056,258,1179,319,830,1498,4965,503,2667,14,1893,288,258,11801,836,476,656,6205,613,4965,503,356,315,6808,417,14,315,448,248,77,408,263,7240,865,2100,524,315,656,6808,504,14,199,199,1213,469,3023,285,503,258,1179,1662,288,429,3651,476,315,1240,1683,2210,263,2072,352,3086,1867,394,4543,315,656,2514,1498,14,315,448,248,77,636,408,1655,1772,485,390,853,17768,285,467,429,417,4543,394,612,485,448,248,261,853,8777,285,12,476,2036,836,341,448,248,83,408,10910,14,315,761,485,28434,781,287,263,9569,287,617,4169,781,791,585,1049,288,263,3651,374,2331,291,618,551,1752,288,4575,49656,476,485,548,408,3941,394,7343,417,1812,1867,287,3086,14,199,199,1859,424,588,1662,619,315,448,248,68,468,1364,291,3961,547,341,781,315,656,1255,524,21101,291,42660,327,2131,562,656,805,380,503,291,617,1752,291,893,285,2406,565,251,43670,485,805,589,263,2100,327,562,8712,423,515,448,252,14,315,448,248,304,1240,9910,258,1518,288,617,1205,14,1407,1910,315,5718,258,8225,352,263,2707,1183,2608,291,1966,607,285,2424,263,270,311,86,9641,285,5880,617,967,14,1847,408,1655,645,2074,315,461,467,285,2246,429,423,5837,758,31,199,199,16351,12,315,448,248,77,656,1973,6640,287,853,29249,277,781,287,263,9569,287,617,4169,291,341,448,248,83,1108,1973,503,867,14,315,448,248,77,3911,327,263,16639,3039,319,285,656,408,6129,613,7472,476,429,2126,448,248,84,263,692,6334,287,7001,327,315,448,248,304,5925,429,352,14,1319,390,1812,14,315,652,9752,656,1017,504,288,1172,3361,476,6971,315,448,248,77,853,7343,291,3941,1839,503,1255,258,1511,1662,4786,14,199,199,3793,613,1998,518,315,461,467,547,341,31,50266,50267],"target":[10,2397,1910,315,5718,258,8225,352,263,2707,1183,2608,291,1966,607,285,2424,263,270,311,86,9641,285,5880,617,967,15886,199,199,10249,1,221,844,12,1561,478,535,2461,547,535,1999,352,327,3651,1166,14,1003,512,4070,4941,285,2690,512,4221,1628,12,485,1184,424,285,1488,512,8436,14,199,199,41,1102,7927,429,3023,285,346,14,50268]}],"length":457},{"created_utc":1506635870,"subreddit":"Advice","author":"ragingratinacage","num_comments":19,"score":17,"title":"Found a dog I gave to a friend in terrible condition. What do I do?","selftext":"I have a rather long backstory to go with this question. A little over a year ago, my husband and I gave a dog to our neighbors (and best friends at the time) because we didn't have the means to care for her at the time. We were friends with them for a little while before they moved next door to us and over the last year, we have come to realize that they are terrible and we're no longer friends. We gave our dog to them when we were still friends shortly after they moved next door. They kept her outside, which is fine because she was a rather large dog that we didn't have the means or room to accommodate at the time.\n\nThat brings us to issue one. Where we are, it is illegal to leave a dog tethered outside. They are supposed to have a fenced in area and not to be tied. However, as they were our friends, we overlooked the problem. Also, she had plenty of room, never got tangled, and had shade and shelter, so we didn't think much of it. Even after we had our falling-out, she appeared to be taken care of. She is a very fluffy dog, so she didn't appear to have any issues.\n\nOver the last year, these people had several animals die on them, including but not limited to two other dogs that starved to death that they got after we gave them our dog. They have had animal control called on them several times due to the dog we gave them being tethered and the conditions that a second dog was being kept in. Other than leave warning after warning, animal control did absolutely nothing. We wanted to get her back badly, but as she was now their dog, there was no legal way to get her without them giving her to us, which was pretty much out of the question given how our friendship ended.\n\nToday, she showed up at our doorstep having broken the rope she was tied to. She was terribly thin, dehydrated, and dirty. I'm unsure what to do because I don't want to just give her back to continue her cycle of neglect, but I don't want to be in any legal trouble either. I also refuse to have her sent to a pound or humane society. As sad as it is, it is rare for larger dogs that aren't puppies to get adopted out and I couldn't handle not knowing whether she was happily adopted or put to sleep.\n\nTL;DR: I gave a dog away a year ago and she showed back up in far worse condition than she was given away in.\n\nWhat should\/can I do?","id":"733fgd","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1507611125,"good_comments":[{"created_utc":1506637562,"subreddit":"Advice","author":"BEU1346","parent_id":"733fgd","link_id":"733fgd","score":32,"body":"Taking the dog is illegal.\n\nBut you mentioned the dog had escaped.

them.","id":"dnnf7f6","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1507190641}],"split":"train","tokens":[{"context":[50257,22857,502,50258,50259,17544,2580,12,2178,50260,50263,21078,258,3291,315,2922,285,258,1546,288,7819,4007,14,1868,467,315,467,31,50264,50265,41,424,258,2139,891,37999,285,468,352,429,1809,14,318,1311,626,258,615,2085,12,617,5230,291,315,2922,258,3291,285,675,12021,358,393,1267,2461,380,263,641,9,781,357,1423,471,424,263,1725,285,1338,330,608,380,263,641,14,776,548,2461,352,607,330,258,1311,982,879,485,3889,1307,3421,285,515,291,626,263,939,615,12,357,424,1283,285,6538,327,485,390,7819,291,357,822,646,2393,2461,14,776,2922,675,3291,285,607,619,357,548,992,2461,8973,707,485,3889,1307,3421,14,1120,4031,608,2355,12,544,319,3735,781,674,374,258,2139,1589,3291,327,357,1423,471,424,263,1725,394,2120,285,15551,380,263,641,14,199,199,2505,6775,515,285,2072,531,14,6351,357,390,12,341,319,5294,285,2667,258,3291,28409,6084,2355,14,1120,390,4386,285,424,258,278,5865,288,1990,291,408,285,308,8166,14,2103,12,356,485,548,675,2461,12,357,21656,263,1918,14,4419,12,674,551,6089,287,2120,12,1240,1393,41432,12,291,551,17980,291,11773,12,524,357,1423,471,893,882,287,341,14,3413,707,357,551,675,7464,13,449,12,674,4121,285,308,2078,1338,287,14,1376,319,258,846,39146,3291,12,524,674,1423,471,1657,285,424,598,2429,14,199,199,5887,263,939,615,12,778,662,551,1812,4696,4657,320,607,12,1391,476,408,3615,285,735,585,6845,327,47225,285,1919,327,485,1393,707,357,2922,607,675,3291,14,1120,424,551,5045,1631,1445,320,607,1812,1662,2234,285,263,3291,357,2922,607,853,28409,6084,291,263,3404,327,258,1219,3291,374,853,4031,288,14,3820,622,2667,6510,707,6510,12,5045,1631,751,5544,2148,14,776,2228,285,652,608,737,11235,12,476,356,674,374,784,512,3291,12,613,374,646,2743,836,285,652,608,1232,607,3502,608,285,515,12,544,374,2496,882,504,287,263,1809,1814,704,675,14739,4445,14,199,199,8889,12,674,3752,511,380,675,41595,1720,5446,263,17183,674,374,8166,285,14,1376,374,22122,7889,12,28152,4112,12,291,11842,14,315,1102,22148,645,285,467,781,315,837,471,766,285,656,1578,608,737,285,2556,608,6773,287,17986,12,476,315,837,471,766,285,308,288,598,2743,5877,2036,14,315,636,11149,285,424,608,1909,285,258,14897,394,31534,3593,14,1082,6508,356,341,319,12,341,319,4072,330,4026,6845,327,3589,471,37794,285,652,8198,504,291,315,3522,471,5413,408,6971,1772,674,374,18178,8198,394,1235,285,3994,14,199,199,14991,27,7708,26,315,2922,258,3291,1498,258,615,2085,291,674,3752,737,511,288,1291,4786,4007,622,674,374,1814,1498,288,14,199,199,2062,816,15,5172,315,467,31,50266,50267],"target":[26557,263,3291,319,5294,14,199,199,1538,346,4751,263,3291,551,13538,14,922,2193,837,471,773,7565,263,12021,3291,7472,12,827,31,922,8524,1415,3242,285,645,485,390,1805,1202,346,822,646,2393,2461,352,607,14,384,3291,327,3752,511,320,535,3421,2240,715,340,1636,1093,1953,10,3291,12,827,31,31280,471,346,911,346,551,618,2461,327,1245,1012,258,3596,10219,28584,3291,258,1179,11685,626,31,3895,429,28584,3291,327,346,424,646,2127,509,319,263,4871,287,319,656,11264,1089,14,28049,471,424,258,19909,14,1401,4581,35903,14,1319,390,646,4815,19380,31,384,12021,4399,471,532,258,1574,285,346,547,512,3291,4815,31,6675,485,3182,327,3291,2642,14,771,3291,320,535,3421,2240,319,258,1181,3291,827,31,771,531,319,836,4169,1009,622,263,531,346,2922,607,258,891,641,2085,12,827,3549,50268]},{"context":[50257,22857,502,50258,50259,17544,2580,12,2178,50260,50263,21078,258,3291,315,2922,285,258,1546,288,7819,4007,14,1868,467,315,467,31,50264,50265,41,424,258,2139,891,37999,285,468,352,429,1809,14,318,1311,626,258,615,2085,12,617,5230,291,315,2922,258,3291,285,675,12021,358,393,1267,2461,380,263,641,9,781,357,1423,471,424,263,1725,285,1338,330,608,380,263,641,14,776,548,2461,352,607,330,258,1311,982,879,485,3889,1307,3421,285,515,291,626,263,939,615,12,357,424,1283,285,6538,327,485,390,7819,291,357,822,646,2393,2461,14,776,2922,675,3291,285,607,619,357,548,992,2461,8973,707,485,3889,1307,3421,14,1120,4031,608,2355,12,544,319,3735,781,674,374,258,2139,1589,3291,327,357,1423,471,424,263,1725,394,2120,285,15551,380,263,641,14,199,199,2505,6775,515,285,2072,531,14,6351,357,390,12,341,319,5294,285,2667,258,3291,28409,6084,2355,14,1120,390,4386,285,424,258,278,5865,288,1990,291,408,285,308,8166,14,2103,12,356,485,548,675,2461,12,357,21656,263,1918,14,4419,12,674,551,6089,287,2120,12,1240,1393,41432,12,291,551,17980,291,11773,12,524,357,1423,471,893,882,287,341,14,3413,707,357,551,675,7464,13,449,12,674,4121,285,308,2078,1338,287,14,1376,319,258,846,39146,3291,12,524,674,1423,471,1657,285,424,598,2429,14,199,199,5887,263,939,615,12,778,662,551,1812,4696,4657,320,607,12,1391,476,408,3615,285,735,585,6845,327,47225,285,1919,327,485,1393,707,357,2922,607,675,3291,14,1120,424,551,5045,1631,1445,320,607,1812,1662,2234,285,263,3291,357,2922,607,853,28409,6084,291,263,3404,327,258,1219,3291,374,853,4031,288,14,3820,622,2667,6510,707,6510,12,5045,1631,751,5544,2148,14,776,2228,285,652,608,737,11235,12,476,356,674,374,784,512,3291,12,

to deal with my brother who is well into his 50s and STILL LIVES OFF OF ME!","selftext":"Hey Reddit, I really need your help. You can call me Antwan.\n\nSo my brother (let's call him Joe) is well into his 50s and still lives off me. You see, we made a pact when we were kids that if one of us was successful, the other would be taken care of. I didn't really think much of it but apparently Joe really took it to heart. So I spent my time working hard, knocking tin and eventually finding success.\n\nJoe however, did nothing. Dreams of being a rockstar or something but all he's ever done is played in cover bands, guess he's not creative enough to write his own music, all I'm saying is that's not how you become a successful musician.\n\nHe's been playing in a U2 cover band for years now but they don't make much money but that's his only real income. They play in library parking lots. Most actual real gigs get cancelled because he goes on racist rants on social media. So that's always been his attitude, say whatever do whatever because I'll be there to support him.\n\nSo now we're both old and I'm not doing as good as I once was. I was fired for no reason and I've lost a lot of money due to troubles with a girl I was seeing.\n\nSo I need to tell him to get a job and stop living off me but I'm worried how it will affect our relationship and if it's too late now anyways. He's not very bright, lazy and out of shape and spends a lot of time just arguing with people online for no reason so it's not like he's very attractive to any employers.\n\nI feel really bad, maybe it's my fault for allowing him to do this for so long but I just can't anymore.\n\nWhat should I do? How do I tell him? Thanks guys.\n\nTL;DR: My well past middle-aged brother is a failure who still lives off of me, what do I do","id":"5nl05p","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1489428077,"good_comments":[{"created_utc":1484245564,"subreddit":"Advice","author":"michaelrulaz","parent_id":"5nl05p","link_id":"5nl05p","score":39,"body":"Just tell him the truth.

He never had to grow up because you let him remain a child. Now he is old and doesn't have any life skills.\n\nPersonally, I think you have a responsibility to at least try to help him become an adult. But for once you need to be firm with him. Give him an ultimatum: find a job within X amount of time. Be contributing 50% of your living expenses within X amount of time. Then help him achieve finding a job. Monitor his efforts. This won't be easy for a 50 year old man who has never worked. Fast food is probably his only option at this point.\n\nIf he can't change then you will have a decision to make. Kick him to the curb and let him fend for himself , or take responsibility for your enabling by continuing to support him. Both are really shitty options.\n\n  I'm not trying to rag on you, but you should have never let it get to this point. Normally I'd just tell you to kick him out because he's an adult. But your actions have allowed a man to grow old without becoming an adult, so the situation is more complicated now. I don't mean to suggest that he is blameless, but you've definitely created a responsibility for yourself

to do about six-year old neighbor who\u2019s maybe being too curious about sex?","selftext":"Hi guys. My boyfriend brought it to my attention that his neighbor\u2019s six-year-old daughter knows \u201ctoo much\u201d about sex. For example, he said, she knows that boys have sex with their penises. I didn\u2019t really believe him until yesterday.\n\nContext: we live in a ground floor apartment and this girl and her family live upstairs. She often plays in our shared yard but since I moved in one month ago I hadn\u2019t seen much of her.\n\nSo yesterday she came up to the window while we were having breakfast and she said \u201cI can see your penis!!\u201d to my boyfriend, who was wearing shorts but no shirt. Once he realized she was creeping around he ran in to get a shirt on, while she was giggling and saying \u201cyou\u2019re naked, you\u2019re naked!\u201d Once he came back she was demanding to know if we were in love, if we were getting married, why we weren\u2019t having kids. All of that was kind of marred by the fact that this child had said penis like two minutes earlier.\n\nWe told her to go back home and promptly shut the doors and windows AND curtains just in case she came back. A little later we were in the bedroom fooling around and no shit, this little kid head popped up out of nowhere outside (we had forgotten to shut the bedroom window but the curtains were drawn) and there she was saying \u201cI see you having sex!\u201d  We put clothes on and again directed her home and made sure ALL the windows in the house were shut after that.\n\nI could not believe that she would say \u201cpenis\u201d or \u201csex\u201d anyway, but the scarier part for me is that it\u2019s really the first time I\u2019m hearing a child use those words in context??\n\nNow before you\u2019re like well, this is just normal six year old behavior, maybe you should talk to her parents....no.\n\nHer parents are super devout Muslims and I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t use this kind of language with her... then don\u2019t even speak English. She most probably learned this stuff at school or with her parent\u2019s friend\u2019s kid who is probably around 10 or 11. They let the kids loose all day and barely even watch them.\n\nMy boyfriend who is an ex-Muslim is extremely hesitant to say anything to them because he\u2019s so sure that they would assume HE is the one doing something wrong to her. I\u2019m caught in the middle wondering if this child is being abused or if she\u2019s just not being parented correctly.\n\nEither way I need some tools for what to do if she comes around again. What kind of things can I say to her to imply that she is not being appropriate and needs to respect our privacy? Or is there another approach to this issue?\n\nThanks!","id":"7ujx4c","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1520470891,"good_comments":[{"created_utc":1517504227,"subreddit":"Advice","author":"panic_bread","parent_id":"7ujx4c","link_id":"7ujx4c","score":59,"body":"If her parents are devout Muslim, definitely don't say anything to them.

It's an example of our shared humanity..how refreshing these days.\n\nYou should obviously take precautions to protect your privacy, and if this fails, you should tell her parents not so much about what she's saying, but what she's doing....which i this case is wandering around unsupervised...which any parent, again regardless of anything...will respond to appropriately by monitoring their

For example, sheets at Target have the height of the mattress they work for printed on them. If you get ones for a taller mattress, this can help.\n\n- there are gadgets that you can put under the sheets on the corners to hold them. Some are like anti slip foam, others are like little suspenders. Just Google it.\n- bonus - if you are using very smooth or satiny sheets, switch to a slightly rougher fabric.

three days I was working on a short indie film as an actress\/dancer, and the guy in question is\/was part of the crew. Two weeks ago after a rehearsal, he texted me (he had my contact from the group chat we are both in) and said something along the lines of \"You can ask me for help anytime if you need anything and also if you have time we can meet for coffee\". I basically just said thanks and ignored the invitation.\n\nWell, yesterday after filming he texted me again, again asking me out, and I just answered that I'd think about it.\n\nOf course I'm really weirded out because I'm in fucking highschool and this grown man apparently wants to go out with me. Or maybe he is just genuinely trying to be friendly? Why would he want to meet with a highschooler??\n\nWe didn't talk too much on set, but some of the things he said to me were:\n\n\"You're cool. I like you.\"\n\n(Whispering and gesturing towards me:) \"So beautiful!'\n\n\"When I look at you I see femininity and youth. It's like a symbol.\"\n\nThat last one in particular is just giving me the heebie-jeebies.\n\nI told my actual mom about his invitation, but she just laughed it off and said \"Just tell him your dad will break his legs\", and while that was hilariously unexpected from her, it doesn't help me practically.\n\nI'm just not sure what to tell him now.

If he pushes the invitation and tries to get a direct answer from you, he will be counting on you feeling like it would be rude to say no. So practice saying \"No thanks!\" now, for low stakes stuff, if it feels uncomfortable.

Ed is visiting me right now.. but I'm so confused and I just need to get this off my chest! It's not that I don't respect my boyfriend and I'm sure a lot of people will judge, but I just cannot bring the courage to end this relationship. I fear to be alone. I don't want to make anyone sad, too. It's just a complete mess.\n\nThe most confusing thing is that our heterosexual friend is cuddling with me, conforting me with kisses on my forehead.. I fought with my boyfriend so I'm sleeping in a bed together with Ed since we don't have a lot of  space to offer.. Every night we're talking quietly about everything which is quite nice. He is hugging me, tucking me into his sheets and we cuddle. My boyfriend is jealous of course who could blame him. I just don't know how to handle this situation. Sometimes I feel like Ed is liking me too, everyone is telling me that's obvious. For me he just seems like a chill dude.\n\nI just don't know what to do ._.

do I talk to the doctor about anxiety?","selftext":"I (20f) have to go to the doctor next week for a regular checkup. I\u2019m living abroad for six months and there is something I need to talk to the doctor about before I leave: my mom has been giving me two medications that are prescribed to her, and now I feel like I need them when I leave.\n\nThe first one isn\u2019t a big deal, it\u2019s just an extra strong ibuprofen that I take when my cramps are bothering me. I don\u2019t feel scared about asking for my own prescription for this. But the other thing is a very low dose lorazepam that my mom lets me take when I\u2019m feeling so anxious that I can\u2019t sleep, the same thing she uses them for. I feel weird about telling my mom I\u2019m anxious, so this doesn\u2019t happen often. They just ease me into going to sleep and calm me down. Maybe it\u2019s even placebo affect, idk.\n\nThis one I am scared to tell the doctor about. Will my mom get in trouble? Will th\u00e9 doc think I\u2019m a drug addict for asking for these pills?\nGenerally, I\u2019m just nervous to be living in a new country so far away from everyone I know. What I\u2019m most terrified for is the plane ride by myself. I\u2019ve never flown alone before. I\u2019m scared I\u2019m going to have to bring myself down from a panic attack on a tiny plane with strangers next to me.\n\nI started having panic attacks after I was sexually assaulted a little over a year ago. I went to a therapist and really didn\u2019t like it. My anxiety has persisted since then I mostly just deal with it. I know that I should probably go back again to a new therapist but I\u2019ve hesitated with the excuse that I\u2019m leaving.\n\nI hav\u00e9 always been anxious thought even before the assault and I have gotten better in small ways. I at least know how to identify when a panic attack is happening and I know how to breathe and calm myself down some. I can live with this but it\u2019s still an issue and I am still very worried that I\u2019m going to look visibly not okay on the plane when panicking (heavy breathing, shaking etc).\n\nHow do I deal with this? How should I go about telling the doctor? Should I avoid telling her bc I\u2019ve been taking my moms pills (w her permission)?\n\n\u00c9dit: Th\u00e9 last time a went abroad (with a friend and only for a month) my mom gave me a few of both of these pills in case I needed them, but I\u2019m going for much longer this time. I don\u2019t want to tell her I\u2019m talking to the doctor about this bc she does not know the extent of my anxiety and I know she\u2019s already worried about me moving somewhere alone.","id":"a72hdw","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1548920631,"good_comments":[{"created_utc":1545074696,"subreddit":"internetparents","author":"Guygan","parent_id":"a72hdw","link_id":"a72hdw","score":75,"body":"In my experience, in the US, the doctor will not report you or your mother to the police for \"diverting\" her prescription.\n\nThe way to get a prescription for anxiety meds is to just talk to your doctor in detail about how bad it is for you.

Just explain your anxiety and then ask if there are any meds you can get to help with acute anxiety.","id":"ebzuwct","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1547734288}],"split":"train","tokens":[{"context":[50257,37676,23744,50258,50259,20589,1597,12,2865,50260,50263,2438,467,315,1562,285,263,6254,547,9752,31,50264,50265,41,358,1239,70,9,424,285,468,285,263,6254,1307,1286,330,258,3219,2199,930,14,315,448,248,77,2878,10523,330,2238,1934,291,613,319,1224,315,762,285,1562,285,263,6254,547,879,315,2667,26,617,1996,469,588,3502,503,735,17639,327,390,14799,285,608,12,291,784,315,1255,589,315,762,607,619,315,2667,14,199,199,465,718,531,2126,448,248,84,258,1264,1731,12,341,448,248,83,656,282,3132,1914,24284,930,306,41038,327,315,1012,619,617,1068,9431,390,41657,503,14,315,837,448,248,84,1255,12009,547,4738,330,617,899,15078,330,429,14,888,263,585,1518,319,258,846,1878,10743,301,274,1032,539,322,327,617,1996,8782,503,1012,619,315,448,248,77,4204,524,18117,327,315,461,448,248,84,3994,12,263,977,1518,674,3545,607,330,14,315,1255,7651,547,5150,617,1996,315,448,248,77,18117,12,524,429,1596,448,248,84,1646,1691,14,1120,656,10153,503,657,1017,285,3994,291,9481,503,867,14,6675,341,448,248,83,773,17652,2690,12,4687,75,14,199,199,1213,531,315,717,12009,285,1561,263,6254,547,14,2562,617,1996,652,288,5877,31,2562,295,2635,2206,893,315,448,248,77,258,2564,19679,330,4738,330,778,19522,31,199,37059,12,315,448,248,77,656,10928,285,308,2878,288,258,650,1500,524,1291,1498,423,2507,315,761,14,1868,315,448,248,77,750,22145,330,319,263,6615,6595,417,3590,14,315,448,248,304,1240,22372,3437,879,14,315,448,248,77,12009,315,448,248,77,1017,285,424,285,2223,3590,867,423,258,13620,1369,320,258,7010,6615,352,18982,1307,285,503,14,199,199,41,2068,1720,13620,3435,707,315,374,11364,18514,258,1311,626,258,615,2085,14,315,1817,285,258,24637,291,1108,1423,448,248,84,589,341,14,2012,9752,469,33265,1202,789,315,4633,656,1731,352,341,14,315,761,327,315,816,2193,468,737,758,285,258,650,24637,476,315,448,248,304,41724,352,263,12227,327,315,448,248,77,4306,14,199,199,41,388,86,2635,1465,588,18117,1808,773,879,263,4642,291,315,424,7892,1366,288,1403,2843,14,315,380,1552,761,704,285,5912,619,258,13620,1369,319,5837,291,315,761,704,285,18045,291,9481,3590,867,618,14,315,461,2108,352,429,476,341,448,248,83,992,282,2072,291,315,717,992,846,7961,327,315,448,248,77,1017,285,805,30545,408,8789,320,263,6615,619,3426,7959,358,23702,12705,12,17276,3504,738,199,199,2438,467,315,1731,352,429,31,1375,816,315,468,547,5150,263,6254,31,10359,315,3369,5150,608,47126,315,448,248,304,588,2264,617,34016,19522,358,87,608,7171,19428,199,199,38352,5267,26,537,2635,939,641,258,1817,10523,358,4481,258,1546,291,692,330,258,1228,9,617,1996,2922,503,258,1179,287,1112,287,778,19522,288,1340,315,2623,607,12,476,315,448,248,77,1017,330,882,2393,429,641,14,315,837,448,248,84,766,285,1561,608,315,448,248,77,3376,285,263,6254,547,429,47126,674,858,408,761,263,6288,287,617,9752,291,315,761,674,448,248,83,1542,7961,547,503,3868,7383,3437,14,50266,50267],"target":[819,617,1999,12,288,263,1295,12,263,6254,482,408,990,346,394,535,2803,285,263,1645,330,367,68,1429,890,2,608,15078,14,199,199,465,836,285,652,258,15078,330,9752,1118,83,319,285,656,1562,285,535,6254,288,3704,547,704,2090,341,319,330,346,14,13787,10018,6097,287,704,341,22534,3049,535,1205,14,384,6254,461,1578,346,618,1366,3690,622,301,274,1032,539,322,14,199,199,1533,346,1561,535,6254,367,10815,12,2131,469,588,3502,503,301,274,1032,539,322,291,341,339,1050,1,1681,315,652,518,3549,1702,478,287,263,2267,9702,482,468,34883,15959,291,346,1184,1240,652,607,14,2330,4728,535,9752,291,789,1266,612,613,390,598,1118,83,346,461,652,285,1038,352,14353,9752,14,50268]}],"length":473},{"created_utc":1513315785,"subreddit":"internetparents","author":"ELite_Predator28","num_comments":17,"score":54,"title":"I'm seriously worried about my father's mental health, and I'm worried that I've just pushed him too far. Help?","selftext":"Hi guys I am a M\/18 and my dad is very stressed out at the moment. He's a 4th grade teacher who is almost 60 and he works at a school where most of his class doesn't care if they fail or not. He's the bread-winner of my family. He's become very jaded in regards to teaching but he can't quit because we need the insurance benefits and money. Every time I speak to him I feel like I'm walking on eggshells; this isn't normal for him. I've tried my best to give him advice but he still comes home sad, depressed and angry.\n\nHe also has issues with his thyroid, though I don't know what that means. He says he's just getting old.\n\nI went to go see Star Wars tonight with him and my little brother, I left the theater to get more food and I went back into the wrong theater which had the same start time as my tickets which I bought off of Fandango. I seated net to people who looked like my father and my little brother. I sat for the first 10 mins of the movie, and then my dad showed up with my little brother and security sangry (sad and angry). As soon as security disappeared he starts yelling and screaming at me, calling me a cocksucker and other profanities. He told me he was worried I just disappeared and that he was going to cry. He then slammed his fist on a nearby table and knocked it down and walked outside.\n\nMy and my little brother tried to get him to come back in but he told me to get away from him and go watch the movie. We persisted by eventually he made a scene and we had to go back in. We finished the movie and we went back outside to see him standing outside in the cold. I tried to apologize to him but he told me to stop and shut up.\n\nIt was an awkward ride home.\n\nWhat the hell do I do now? I want to tell him to cry and let it all out or go see a shrink but I'm afraid that will piss him off more. I've been severely depressed and I feel like I looked like him before.\n\nHELP?","id":"7jxpxr","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1515332963,"good_comments":[{"created_utc":1513325077,"subreddit":"internetparents","author":"Dsblhkr","parent_id":"7jxpxr","link_id":"7jxpxr","score":15,"body":"When thyroid meds are off it really can throw off someone\u2019s emotions.

fashion and will eventually work in it, and i\u2019m being presented with the opportunity to intern in Paris for 6 months for a big company. It sounds amazing to everyone, but I don\u2019t feel the same. I currently live in the UK but i\u2019m not from here originally, and at the moment i\u2019ve never felt happier in my life, circumstance wise. However, the internships here aren\u2019t as great.\n\nI don\u2019t think i\u2019m ready to mentally uproot myself again and move countries, but I feel like i\u2019m shooting myself in the foot if I don\u2019t intern in this company, however tbh I only want to intern here because I think it looks good on my CV when i\u2019m applying to jobs in the future.\n\nUpon introspection, my main reason for refusing to go to Paris is simply because I dread knowing that i\u2019m not meant to be in the UK forever; I am on a student visa that lasts til 2020\/2021 (if I do a masters), and I hate thinking that I will lose 6 months of a perfectly valid visa surrounded by my closest friends and a happy home life. I don\u2019t have friends in my home country and moving to the UK was a life changer for me, mentally. I always have anxiety about the day I leave the country indefinitely, and have to say goodbye to the life I know.\n\nSorry for the wall of text, and thank you if you\u2019ve read this far.\n\nI just want to know how to proceed; share me your experiences, if you\u2019ve been in the same place.. will this internship matter in the long run? please let me know if there\u2019s any questions.

I also don't believe in doing something solely to put on a CV.\n\nHowever, you are studying fashion and say you want to work in fashion. Therefore, it would be incredibly stupid to not intern in Paris. If fashion is something you are passionate about, then going to Paris should be something you're dreaming about and would not question if the opportunity arose. So the big question is: Why are you questioning it???\n\nDo you really want to be studying fashion? Why are you studying fashion if Paris doesn't interest you at all? Why exactly have you chosen fashion as a career choice?  If it's not something you love, then perhaps you should be focusing on something else.\n\nWhat would you think if someone said they wanted to work with the space program, but didn't want to intern at NASA??? You'd think they were nuts.\n\nThe whole \"I love the UK\" thing really has no bearing at all on not wanting to go to Paris. Don't use that as an excuse. If you're really worried about that, find a way to stay in the UK permanently. Switch majors if you have to in order to get a job in London.","id":"edqnwvj","gilded":false,"retrieved_on":1551173485},{"created_utc":1547149477,"subreddit":"internetparents","author":"OloShrodo","parent_id":"aeltm0","link_id":"aeltm0","score":59,"body":"Leaving home is always difficult, but the opportunities are always worth the experience in my opinion.

pretty awful happened to me today. I need some general advice.","selftext":"I'm writing this here because what I honestly need is the kind of advice people gets from their parents, partly because I have some problems with mine. General advice from people that is just a little older and thus more experienced. I'm a young adult. (edit: just found out I'm literally the target audience lol)\n\nToday at work I was trying to behave normally and get the job done, but I was seriously stressed out by a personal problem with a couple toxic family members I need to learn to fucking ignore, which is another story. On top of that, after lunch, I felt like I needed to take a shit (I apologize for being gross, but there's no other way to talk about this. Marked NSFW just in case.) but held it because I had gone before and didn't want to be called out or something, won't do that again.\n\nAnd to the point, just moments ago at home taking a shit (I ended up not doing it before), I noticed a smell right after sitting down and noticed my underwear was stained brown, which is weird because I never noticed shitting myself even a little, that'd be weird since I'm young and that never happened before even in stressful situations, and it's very concerning. Maybe I just wiped poorly or something, hope it was just that but idk. There wasn't much on my underwear but not just a little bit either which is why I'm concerned, and on my pants there's nothing but the butt area smells a little.\n\nWhat do you think is the chance I actually smelled bad at work in a situation like this? I didn't notice any smell myself until before as I said, my pants smelled a little but that's because I got close to see, but as always it's hard to tell with your own smell so I've no idea.
